one aimlessly pushes the grasses
aside in search
the rivers are wide
the mountains far away
and the path becomes longer
exhausted and dispirited
one hears only the late autumn cicadas
shrilling in the maple woods
by the water, and under the trees
there are numerous traces
fragrant grasses grow thickly
but did you see the ox?
even in the depths
of the distant mountain forest
how could the upturned nostrils
of the ox be concealed?
a bush warbler sings upon a branch
warm sun, soft breezes
green willows on the bank
nowhere can the ox escape to hide
but those majestic horns
are difficult to draw
with all my energy
i seize the ox
his will is strong, and his power endless
and he cannot be tamed easily
sometimes he charges
to the high plateau
and there he stays
deep in the mist
one does not let go of the whip or the rope
afraid it will stray
and choose the dusty mist
a well-tended ox becomes gentle
and even with no rope
will follow people
by himself
riding the bull, i leisurely
wander toward home
exotic flute melodies echo
through sunset clouds
each beat and each tune
is indescribably profound
no words are needed for those
who understand music
riding on the ox
he has come home
there is no ox there
and he is at ease
although the sun is high
he is still dreamy
the whip and rope abandoned
in the thatched hut
whip, rope, man, and ox
all are non-existent
the blue sky being vast
no message can be heard
just as the snowflake cannot last
in the flaming red furnace
after this state, one can join
the ancient teachers
in returning to the fundamentals
and going back to the source
i had to work so hard
perhaps it would be better
to be blind and deaf
being in the hut
i do not see what is outside
the river flowing tranquilly
the flower simply being red
he enters the city barefoot
with chest exposed
covered in dust and ashes
smiling broadly
no need for the magic powers
of the gods and immortals
just let the dead tree bloom again

1 Searching for the Ox
Brushing aside thick grasses I pursue him,
In wide rivers, distant mountains, and deep roads.
Exhausted, unable to find him anywhere,
I only hear evening cicadas in the maple trees.

2  Discovering the Footprints
Scores of footprints in the forests and by the streams,
Do you see them scattered amid the fragrant grass?
Even deep in the remote mountains,
How can he conceal his enormous snout?

3  Sighting the Ox
A golden oriole trills on the branch,
The sun is warm, the wind mild,
And the lakeside willow green.
Now there is nowhere for the ox to escape!
Yet who can paint the intricate details of his head and
horns?

4  Catching the Ox
With extraordinary effort I catch the ox;
Strong of body and spirit, he is not easily subdued.
At times, he scales the lofty plains,
Then hides deep within the mist and clouds.

5  Taming the Ox
I must never let go of the whip and rein,
Lest he strides down the dusty trail.
By patiently taming and subduing the ox,
He'll follow me without the leash.

6 | Riding the Ox Home
Mounting the ox I meander home;
The sound of my flute rides with the evening glow.
Each beat, each tune holds meaning profound;
No need for words if you understand this song.

7 | The Ox Transcended
Astride the ox I reach my native hill,
The ox has vanished, and I am free.
I dream until the sun is high;
The rein and whip lie idle in the barn.

8 | Both Ox and Self Transcended
Whip, rein, person, and ox are all just empty,
How can words touch the vast blue sky?
How can snow accrue on a burning stove?
Here finally, I walk with the Patriarchs.

9 I Returning to the Source
Returning to ones root has taken much effort,
Better to just act blind and deaf this moment!
Within my hut I see nothing without;
Rivers flow of themselves and
Flowers naturally bloom.

10 | Entering the World
Bare-chested and barefoot,
I step into the teeming world;
Though covered in mud, I beam with joy.
Without the need for secret miraculous powers,
I make flowers bloom from withered wood.
