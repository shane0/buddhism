methods to subdue emotions

During the conversation, it just happened that a turtle
crawled out from the river to the shore, and a fox in search of
food saw the turtle and was eager to catch it for dinner. Noticing
the fox's approach, the turtle immediately hid its head, tail, and
limbs in its shell to protect itself. Seeing only a hard shell left, the
fox eventually went away.
Upon witnessing this incident, the Buddha told the culti-
vator, "See, the turtle saved its own life by hiding its head and
limbs well. We should cultivate like how the turtle protected
itself. That is, we must know: cultivation is to work on our six
senses-eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. If we can be
in control of these six senses at every moment and be the master
of them, our emotions will be subdued, and our mind will calm
naturally. Otherwise, due to strong wandering thoughts, we
cannot control our mind, always worry about gains and losses,
and lose the direction of our cultivation. Then, we feel agitated
and overwhelmed by a sense of emptiness."
