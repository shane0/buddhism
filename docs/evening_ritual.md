# morning & evening ritual

- the heart sutra is a summary of the diamond sutra
- all I do on a busy day is the heart sutra
- on a long day I review everything on this page and try to keep it brief
- the diamond sutra is a summary of the mahaprajnaparamita
- the mahaprajnaparamita is 600 scrolls

## workflow

### on a busy day

- on a busy day I just speak or chant the heart sutra & meditate

### on a long day

- I open this page on my laptop and update it
- I listen to all the videos
- I take notes and leave comments that trace the iterations of my daily practice over 5 years

## note

- this information is thousands of years old & has traveled through many translations
- if you are new to buddhism I'm not sure this will make sense for a while
- it would work but it helps to have some basic understanding
- I plan to write up some basics that should be learned
- some of it is scattered throughout this site over the years there is a dropdown menu to switch years
- the main problme is there is a lot of jargon and words that do not translate to english

## mind ground meditation

- this meditation gets to the point
- [mind ground](mind_ground.md){ .md-button }

## prajna paramita

## body

- [upa yoga](https://youtu.be/Jf5qUhz-FVk)
- deadlifts or squats <https://youtu.be/HLha33SzaaU>

## videos

- take notes as you listen to these
- this bach song is played at the end of cormac mccarthy's audiobook stella maris - cormac has a page here
- maranasati is the king of meditations and can be used to identify what you cling to
- if you die tonight is there anything you will cling to or anything left undone?
- what is undone you do the next day
- what you cling to you meditate on with impermanence or minimalism pack it away in the garage or attic for a while
- the coins of this world have no value in the next
- the rest dissect the baggage including false self body mind and other divisions
- the heart and diamond sutra are always useful for beginning middle and end
- these sutras include letting go of all baggage and delusion
- there is no wisdom and no attainment
- there is nothing to be achieved by way of prajna paramita
