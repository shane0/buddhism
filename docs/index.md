### physics & buddhism

PHYSICS: the world is made up of tiny things called atoms, atoms follow rules with no known exceptions, atoms form different shapes and these shapes are not permanent

BUDDHISM: suffering comes from clinging to things and wishing they last forever

- to end suffering, accept and understand things are atoms and atoms change form without exception
- the practice is about how to let go of ignorance and see the world clearly as it is
