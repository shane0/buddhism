Make sure your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Hold this position for as long as you can.
- Bridge:
  - The bridge is another great exercise for strengthening your core muscles. To do a bridge, lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground. Raise your hips off the ground until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Hold this position for as long as you can.
- Superman: 
  - The superman is an exercise that strengthens your back muscles. To do a superman, lie on your stomach with your arms and legs extended. Raise your arms and legs off the ground and hold them for as long as you can.
- Bird dog:
  - The bird dog is an exercise that strengthens your back muscles and improves your balance. To do a bird dog, start on your hands and knees. Extend your right arm and left leg out straight. Hold this position for a few seconds, then return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.
- Side plank:
  - The side plank is an exercise that strengthens your core muscles and improves your balance. To do a side plank, start in a push-up position with your right forearm on the ground. Stack your left foot on top of your right foot and raise your hips off the ground until your body forms a straight line from your head to your feet. Hold this position for as long as you can, then repeat on the other side.

You can start by doing 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions of each exercise.

As you get stronger, you can increase the number of sets and repetitions, or add more weight.

It is important to listen to your body and rest when you need to.
If you experience any pain, stop the exercise and consult with a doctor or physical therapist.
