> **We meditate on the Supreme Lord, the effulgent light of the divine Savitur, who inspires our intellect.**

It is a universal prayer for spiritual enlightenment and knowledge. It can be chanted by anyone, regardless of their religion or beliefs.

The Gayatri Mantra is often chanted at the beginning and end of yoga practice, but it can also be chanted at any time or place. It is a powerful mantra that can help to purify the mind, sharpen the intellect, and promote spiritual growth.

To chant the Gayatri Mantra, simply sit or stand in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths to relax and center yourself. Then, begin to chant the mantra slowly and deliberately. You can chant it out loud or silently in your mind.

As you chant the mantra, focus on its meaning and how it applies to your life. Meditate on the light of the divine Savitur and ask for guidance and inspiration.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the meaning of each word in the Gayatri Mantra:

* **Om** is a sacred sound that is said to represent the entire universe.
* **Bhur** represents the physical planf existence.
* **Bhuvah** represents the mental plane of existence.
* **Suvah** represents the spiritual plane of existence.
* **Tat** represents the Supreme Being.
* **Savitur** represents the divine sun, which is a symbol of light and knowledge.
* **Varenyam** means "adorable" or "worthy of worship."
* **Bhargo** means "effulgent light" or "divine splendor."
* **Devasya** means "of the divine" or "of the Supreme Being."
* **Dheemahi** means "we meditate" or "we contemplate."
* **Dhiyo** means "intellect" or "understanding."
* **Yo** means "which" or "that."
* **Nah** means "our."
* **Prachodayat** means "may He inspire" or "may He enlighten."

The Gayatri Mantra is a powerful and beautiful mantra that can help us to connect with the divine and to grow spiritually. I encourage you to chant it often and to experience its benefits for yourself.
