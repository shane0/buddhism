# Tom Gilmore 

this man is an example of natural equanimity and compassion i wish he wrote a book i'd read it

```text
i've learned that there is more in the man than there is in the land

and i've got my riches within my soul

it's just kind of a precious thing

nobody can take that away from me

even if it takes my life it's being passed on to other people and it will keep going
