# vipassana

typically this one is done on a retreat after and with shamatha

it is similar to impermanence in [ngondro](../dzogchen/ngondro.md)

not only are you going to eventually die, but all the physical objects you might rely on for hapiness are also impermanent[^1]

the english language does not have any words to accurately describe vipassana

the word emptiness is used but pay attention to the definitions below closely 

"the goal of vipaśyanā is to realize the emptiness of all phenomena"
-- Alan Wallace from the book Heart of the Great Perfection

vipaśyanā (Skt., Tib. lhag mthong ). Lit. “superior vision,” contemplative insight into fundamental aspects of reality, such as impermanence, suffering, nonself, identylessness and emptiness.
-- Alan Wallace from the book Heart of the Great Perfection

"vipashyana (Skt.) Insight, clear seeing. Vipashyana meditation emphasizes the recognition of all that appears arises from emptiness; it is inseperable from emptiness, and it dissolves into emptiness. Vipashyana is the direct, experiential insight that all experience does indeed appear, yet cannot be captured by words and concepts, and so is fundamentally as ungraspable and groundless as space."
-- Mingyur Rinpoche from his book Turning Confusion into Clarity
