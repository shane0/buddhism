LINJI was a Zen Buddhist monk who lived in China. He taught that people can suddenly become enlightened by seeing through their own delusions.

Linji taught a number of ways to help people see through their own delusions. He used riddles, meditation, and other methods to help people see beyond their own assumptions.

- true: If you want to know the truth, don't talk about it
- awareness expanded: The whole universe is your body
- as it is / spontaneous  "Don't be attached to anything, not even to enlightenment."
- action: "If you want to know the truth, act like it."

The Record of Linji (Linji lu) is a collection of sayings and stories about the Chinese Zen master Linji Yixuan (J. Rinzai Gigen). It is one of the most important texts in the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism.

The Record of Linji was compiled by his disciples in the late Tang dynasty (618-907).

- The importance of spontaneity: Linji encouraged his students to be spontaneous and free from attachments. He said, "Don't be attached to anything, not even to enlightenment."
- The importance of action: Linji believed that the best way to understand Zen is to put it into practice. He said, "If you want to know the truth, act like it."

The Record of Linji is a challenging but rewarding text. It can help us to see the world in a new way and to experience the truth of Zen for ourselves.

## riddles

Linji Yixuan is known for his enigmatic and paradoxical teachings, which were often expressed in riddles or koans. Some of his most famous riddles include:

- What is the sound of one hand clapping?
- If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.
- A dog has no Buddha-nature.

These riddles are designed to challenge the student's conceptual thinking and to help them to see beyond their own assumptions.

For example, the riddle "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" is asking the student to imagine something that is impossible. This is meant to help the student to see that their own thoughts and concepts are not reality.

The riddle "If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him" is a warning to the student not to become attached to any one idea or teaching, even if it comes from the Buddha himself. This is because attachment can lead to suffering.

The riddle "A dog has no Buddha-nature" is meant to challenge the student's belief in the duality of existence. The student may believe that there is a difference between the Buddha and the dog, but Linji is teaching that all beings are fundamentally the same.

Linji's riddles are not meant to be answered literally. Instead, they are meant to be pondered and reflected upon until the student has a sudden breakthrough in understanding.
