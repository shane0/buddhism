## Khenpo Gangshar Naturally Liberating Whatever You Meet[^1]

- “DISTINGUISH THIS **PRACTICE** FROM **==DISTRACTION==**”
- “DISTINGUISH **AWARENESS** AND **MIND OR THOUGHT**”
- simply to rest in the natural
- empty cognizance
- Look directly at whatever arises
- do not attempt to alter it.
- gaze into space; keep your mouth slightly open and breathe naturally
- Karma is positive long as you Remain thought free
- Awareness of emptiness vs ignorance or forgetting

distinguish the difference between the **clinging** and the **open spaciousness** of our underlying nature
Scott Tusa

!!! note "Naturally liberating whatever you meet"

    All is neither false nor true,
    Like the moon’s reflection in water, say the wise.
    The ordinary mind is none other than
    The dharmadhātu, the buddha nature”
