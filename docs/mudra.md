## In terms of Linji Chan

mudras are seen as a way to express the oneness of all things. They are also seen as a way to focus the mind and to promote spiritual development.

Linji Chan is a school of Zen Buddhism that emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and direct insight. Linji Chan teachers often use mudras to help their students to achieve enlightenment.

Some of the mudras that are commonly used in Linji Chan include:

* **Diamond mudra** (vajra mudra): This mudra is formed by touching the thumbs and index fingers together at the tips, creating a diamond shape. It is said to represent the union of opposites, such as wisdom and compassion, masculine and feminine, and heaven and earth.
* **Fist mudra** (muen mudra): This mudra is formed by making a fist with each hand. It is said to represent strength and determination.
* **Lotus mudra** (padmasana mudra): This mudra is formed by placing the palms together and interlocking the fingers, with the thumbs touching. It is said to represent purity and enlightenment.
* **Sword mudra** (ken mudra): This mudra is formed by placing the right hand palm down on the left hand palm, with the thumbs touching. It is said to represent wisdom and courage.

Linji Chan teachers often use mudras in conjunction with meditation and other spiritual practices. They may also use mudras to teach their students about the teachings of Linji Chan.
