i use his meditation app dailly and listen to the people he interviews

studied dzhogchen from [Tulku_Urgyen_Rinpoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulku_Urgyen_Rinpoche) -

his dhogzhen instructions are variations of this, and the "look for your head" and various other forms of turning attention on itself

	The crucial gesture is to attempt to turn attention upon itself and notice what changes in that first instant. 
	Again, it’s not a matter of going deep within. You don’t have to work up to this thing. 
	It’s a matter of looking for the looker and in that first moment noticing what consciousness is like.
