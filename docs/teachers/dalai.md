## 14TH DALAI LAMA
 my interpretations 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_nPcjEHU8E

traing your mind to see from all angles
 positive negative pervades it all
  frequencies - emotions etc. - are local relative impermanent 

peaceful mind
 develop it
  then help others develop it

humans developed mental training
 we can shape our mind
  emotions are frequencies

drawing points to achieve
 world travel - stretch your mind like a muscle using your memories of the furthest places you have traveled
  receive the most transmissions from my gurus I can in this life
  
the west are lacking mental education 
 no mental training or shaping so it has gone wild - idiocracy blind
  
mind should grow more and more calm
