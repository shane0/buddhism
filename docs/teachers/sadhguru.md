Interviewer (Karan Johar): I’m going to take the liberty, Sadhguru,
to do what I normally do on my television show,
which is a rapid fire round.
Sadhguru: Mhmm (Indicating agreement) (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Normally the end of this round..
Sadhguru: (Overlapping conversation) See, I’ve… When I was young,
I watched a lot of, you know,
Wild West movies (Karan Johar laughs).
When you fire, I also fire, all right ?(Laughter/Applause)
Interviewer (Karan Johar): No, but I promise you,
this is not that kind of..
you are not in my line of fire (Sadhguru laughs) at all.
I will not take the liberty of being that person (Laughs).
These are just quick questions, which when I ask for one word,
you have to stick to that
because sometimes you have a tendency of not exactly answering the question asked (Laughter).
But you give such a profound and prolific retort back that it makes you very satiated.
But in this case, my only request is that if it’s one word,
then it’s just one word (Laughs).
Sadhguru: Okay.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): And the end of this normally,
you get a hamper (Laughter).
But in the absence of a hamper here, you already have
Sadhguru: A cow (Laughter).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): …something right… Yes.
So (Laughs)… And… Or this beautiful bouquet that is right next to you.
But so there is no hamper
but you do will get my utmost gratitude (Both laugh).
Thank you.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): All right, very simply,
what is the one thing that is essential to living a balanced life?
Sadhguru: Sense (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): What is the one thing we must absolutely do away with
in order to lead a balanced life?
Sadhguru: Senselessness (Laughter/Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): All right,
I thought that was coming.
First thing that comes to your mind when I say the following –
the first thing. Organized religion.
Sadhguru: Madness.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Marriage.
Sadhguru: Cohabitation (Karan Johar laughs).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Competition.
Sadhguru: Stupid.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Money.
Sadhguru: Useful.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Love.
Sadhguru: Can I say a sentence?(Laughter/Applause)
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Yes.
I will allow that (Laughs).
Sadhguru: Most beautiful but unfortunately crippling for most people (Applause).
If I can little elaborate that..
See, if something unpleasant cripples you,
something nasty cripples you, tch, it’s acceptable.
When something beautiful cripples you,
it’s a true disaster (Laughs) (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): If you could ask one person alive or dead,
one question,
who would you ask and what would that be (Sadhguru laughs)?
Sadhguru: I really sorted out all my questions because
I did not spend time educating myself
or doing anything,
I spent my entire life sorting out every damn question I had.
I kind of run out of questions (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): And you certainly have not run out of any answers (Laughter)
and you never will.
Best advice you have ever received?
Sadhguru: Nothing.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Never?
Sadhguru: No.
I never sought, nor did I receive.
I made myself in such a way,
I’m incapable either of seeking advice or giving advice (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): In an imaginary,
completely hypothetical situation,
if you had a day off with no commitments,
no responsibilities,
what would you spend the day doing?
Sadhguru: Oh! There’re lot of things,
this can't be one word (Laughter).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): No, it’s not one word.
Sadhguru: See, I have an indiscriminate sense of passion towards everything....
There were lots and lots of things I did at one time
but these days, time is not allowing me to do that.
So generally if I have little time, all I do is play golf
because that’s safe and within the city
and I can get back in time for something else to be done.
But if an entire day is left to me –
which they have not done for a long time (Laughs),
they’ve not left it to me –
if that happens, I will close my eyes and sit
because that is my... the best... the best...
I am at my best when I truly have nothing to do (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): What is one thing you’d like people to remember about you at the end of your life?
Sadhguru: They must live so wonderfully that they don’t even remember me (Laughter/Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): If you found a way to travel through time,
where would you go?
Sadhguru: I’m kind of done with all those things (Laughter/Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): You’re universe visited already,
you have visas for every part (Laughs) of this ecosystem.
Sadhguru: If we can do some slow fire...
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Yeah.
Sadhguru: ...because that’s a question with many ramifications.
This..
For example, traveling in the world,
we’ve jetted around and now we want to travel to the Mars,
we want to travel to another place.
And now that’s not enough,
we want to travel into the past and future.
All this longing is again exploratory in nature.
Whether you go on vacation to Maldives
or you want to go to Mars,
it is fundamentally exploratory.
Maybe you’re also thinking of relaxation and pleasure and whatever,
but essentially it’s exploratory,
otherwise why can’t you do it here?
It’s something that you want to do,
you want to touch another place.
This longing is there in the human being
only as long as the life that you are remains in a seed form,
that is, it did not sprout and blossom.
This happened.
When Adiyogi was expounding the science of yoga
and talking about the nature of the cosmos,
how it’s related to your individual self
and what you can do with it,
then the seven sages who were with him,
they asked, “What is the nature of this cosmos?
How big is it?
Where does it begin, where does it end?”
So he laughed and said,
“Your entire cosmos, I can pack it into a mustard seed.”
Because your ideas of time and space are essentially
because you’re living within the framework of your intellect.
If you cross that dimension,
then there is no such thing as time and space.
Everything is here and now.
So, traveling through time, space –
no, it means nothing to me because...
It’s difficult to express,
difficult to articulate.
If I sound little..
I have a reputation of being very logical
but if I sound illogical or silly to you,
you can blame it on my jetlag.
I’ve just come from United States after six weeks,
so you can say,
“Maybe he was jetlagged, that’s why Sadhguru’s saying something silly.”
But I’m fine.
I’m saying this because
you can't fit the universe into your silly little logic.
Today’s human being is too overly enamored with their own logic,
that they’re missing the entire life.
The gamut of phenomena that’s happening in the existence is missed
because the only way you can accept anything is
it has to fit into the square hole of your logic.
Anything that doesn’t fit into your logic,
you will reject.
In this, you’ve rejected the entire cosmos.
In this, you’ve rejected the magic of life.
You have become a slave of logic
and completely missing the magic of life.
So, this time, space, all this stuff is because
intellectually you’re trying to dissect the universe
and try to understand this, this, this.
Tell me, if you sit here,
suppose you’re very joyful,
do you see, you will not know how the day passed off?
And if you’re depressed,
do you see the day won’t pass?
So time is a consequence of the miserable nature of human existence.
If you were truly blissed out and ecstatic,
you wouldn’t know what is a day,
what is a year,
what is a lifetime.
You wouldn’t know.
There’ve been times, I sat down,
I didn’t realize, I thought it’s five minutes
but people gathered around and started molesting my feet (Laughter).
No, because they...
in their understanding I sat there for many days or whatever.
This idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea,
simply because people are stuck in the framework of their logic.
My work, my fundamental work is to take people
beyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence,
our own existence.
But it takes a lot of time.
Still my reputation is of being very logically correct
because I’m still trying to woo them, tch (Both laugh).
Still wooing them, you know (Laughs)?
For the real thing to happen,
they will take a long time unfortunately
because they have become such slaves of their logic.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): What is the first thing you notice when you meet a person?
Sadhguru: Just everything.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Everything?
Sadhguru: Everything. Past, present and future (Karan Johar laughs) (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Is it more important to do what you love or love what you’re doing?
Sadhguru: One word or more (Laughter)?
Interviewer (Karan Johar): The choice is entirely yours.
Sadhguru: See, if you are an intelligent person, you will try to do what you love most.
But if you’re a genius, you will do just what is needed (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): If you could be invisible for a day, what would you do (Laughter)?
Sadhguru: You wouldn’t know (Laughter/Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): With due respect, what is your biggest weakness?
Sadhguru: Hmm? Biggest (Laughter)?
Interviewer (Karan Johar): What is your biggest weakness?
Sadhguru: See, what normally people treat as weakness in their lives...
Okay, let me give a normal answer,
why...
why am I going into all this?
Already you said I’m... what?
What is the word?
Sashayed hmm (Both laugh)?
My biggest weakness is I love danger.
Without danger, I cannot live.
I need to do something, which...
which keeps me on the edge of being mortal,
being alive and dead.
I want to walk that line all the time.
Every day I’m stepping on it one way or the other (Few applaud).
Is it a weakness?
I don’t think so,
but people think. “Sadhguru, you shouldn’t risk your life like this.”
But if there’s no risk,
I feel I’m not being...
Because most of the time in my life,
for whatever I’m doing,
I don’t feel tested.
It’s only in moments of danger that I feel little tested.
So my weakness is, I like to be stretched, you know?
For all the time when I was riding across India
and later on I started driving,
my only wish was that... to find a machine,
which will test my skills.
Always found the damn things broke down if I took it to my limits.
These days recently,
I’m beginning to get to do a few machines,
which are testing me,
whether I can push it all the way or not (Both laugh).
Maybe that’s because of my age (Karan Johar laughs).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): No.
Sadhguru: If I had met them much younger, I think I would have
Interviewer (Karan Johar): You would have managed to work around them (Sadhguru laughs).
One thing the world doesn’t know about you?
Sadhguru: They don’t know a thing about me (Laughter/Applause).
That’s a fact (Both laugh).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): And the one thing you wish you could change about yourself?
Sadhguru: Oh, I never looked at that (Few laugh).
I could speak Hindi (Laughter/Applause).
No, I’m sorry, Marathi (Laughter/Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): The one thing you wish you could change about the world?
Sadhguru: Tch, oh, a lot of things.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): One.
Sadhguru: Human beings (Laughter).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Desperately in need of (Sadhguru laughs).
Sir, what would you consider to be your greatest achievement?
Sadhguru: I don’t think there’s any
because I always fall woefully short of my own expectation of what I could do (Applause).
So, I never feel anything is an achievement (Laughs).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Is there a song you love
and can listen to all the time?
Sadhguru: Oh (Laughs)! I somehow...
(Someone starts singing Tamil song Alai Alai) (Laughter)
No (Laughs).
Probably because this came to me at a certain time
when I was in my early teens maybe,
so this one song kind of comes back to me more often than anything else.
It’s not that I even seek it but somehow, one way or the other,
this song keeps coming back to me, is
“How many times” (Referring to Blowing in the Wind by Bob Dylan) (Both laugh).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Okay, okay. I know you haven’t seen any of my films
but do you have a favorite film?
Sadhguru: Oh! I’ve seen many good movies.
At one time, I saw a lot of them.
I’ve not seen much of Indian cinema
but I saw a lot of, you know, English cinema.
But one movie that I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed at that time
because on that day the way things happened,
many life situations fell together and everything,
was Roman Holiday.
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Oh (Applause)!
Well, I have to say that that’s the first film I’ve ever seen in my life,
my mother took me to the cinema (Sadhguru laughs).
Sadhguru: Here we are!
Interviewer (Karan Johar): It is true,
Roman Holiday is the first film I ever saw,
it was my introduction to the big screen (Sadhguru laughs).
I’m glad I have something in common with you (Laughter).
Sadhguru: That image of Audrey and Gregory Peck is...
somehow just stayed with me (Laughs).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Wonderful.
Sadhguru: It was probably my age (Both laugh).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): Yeah, it must have been.
Something you enjoy doing and wish you had more time for?
Sadhguru: I wish I had more time
because I made myself like this,
that there is nothing that I enjoy or do not enjoy.
I make sure I enjoy everything that I do,
including simply sitting quietly,
or talking to somebody or doing whatever.
Because my activity is not limited to one area,
so many things.
If you did not enjoy everything that you do and do not do,
you will go insane trying to manage so many things.
But I’ll not go insane because
I enjoy being alive.
Activity is...
Anything is okay.
Everything I do, I enjoy (Both laugh).
Small things, big things, every kind of thing.
Most profound things and silly things, I enjoy thoroughly (Both laugh) (Applause).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): As should us all.
Lastly, in a biopic made on you, who would play you (Laughter)?
Sadhguru: But who would make a biopic, first of all (Laughter)?
Interviewer (Karan Johar): No, there would be lots of interested people.
Sadhguru: Maybe you should animate (Laughter).
Interviewer (Karan Johar): I don’t think you would want that (Both laugh).
Well, that is the end of the rapid fire
and you totally deserve the hamper that doesn’t exist on this platform (Laughter).
But it’s a virtual hamper that I’ve given to you
with my (Both laugh) love, gratitude and deepest amount of respect.
Thank you (Both laugh) (Applause). Sadhguru: Thank you.
