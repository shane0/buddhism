what is here now
 when there is no problem to solve
  where are you aware from
   notice what is arising
    emotions about things arising
     shift from content to context

EFFORTLESS NON DUALITY

space is emptiness?
 form is emptiness?

? - aware of?
 recognition - aware from
  realization - aware as

be aware of
 from thought - tiny self - self centered
  from looking - sights - space - objects
   from sounds 
    from space
     as space

"Thinking and the five senses can't know your true nature, your ego will not wake up, the seeker who begins the journey cannot find the true self. Only awareness can know who you already are." ~Loch Kelly


not focused on any one sense or thinking but being empty space
 observe the thinker speaker talker from the space that is open vast and aware already
