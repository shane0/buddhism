!!! quotes
	"you can meditate anytime, anywhere, using anything..."

	"the real measure is what happens off the cusion"
	
	"awareness is the essence of meditation" 
	
	"what really counts is what happens off the cusion" <-- this is big for me, every moment is an opportunity for you to take pause and consider your awareness, turn to your self, as the observer, then consider worthy intentions to stay on your path
