> WHY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF SUFFERING - Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche
>> The first noble truth makes it clear that there is suffering.  Once we know what suffering is, we must eliminate that suf- fering. It is not a question of eliminating the suffering itself but of eliminating the causes of suffering. Once we remove the causes of suffering, then automatically the effect, which is suffering, is no longer present. This is why, to eliminate this suffering, we must become aware of the second noble truth, the truth of universal origination.
