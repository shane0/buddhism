* [x] the sharp vajra of conscious awareness tantra

also notes on conssciousness from this video

the scientific answer is we have no clue and so cannot even begin to define how to measure it, no clue, 

science is the observation of external objects, this might be an internal sub atomic particle, or even not a particle

* shamata currently is the telescope
* vajrayana is the science
* there is nowhere to get a phd and achieve shamata, we are on our own but it can be done
