## thoughts

i got the audio book, prefer when authors narrate their own books because the intention is there

but in this case this narrator reads well so it's not distracting

the contents are condensed, accurate afaik, worldly and ancient

this is dhogzhen simplified

highly recommended

i did most of the practices, but while falling asleep so i'll add more when i do it more awake but it's amazing i know this
