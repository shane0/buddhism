spiritual related books i've read...

read some of the vedas

read zen flesh zen bones, but it was so long ago i'm re reading it

some books about astral projection and tried that with some success,  when i astral project or remote view it is more of an imaginative process not literal, conceptually i can reexperience locations i have been fairly vividly

read a little about vivid dreaming and had some dreams that felt as real as awake reality

read and practiced hypnotism and mesmorism for a while, it's very easy and amusing but it is temporary and might be detrimental so i don't recommend it or do it anymore
