# the seven round compassion contemplation

this contemplation includes seven rounds.

each round has seven steps to reflect upon our relationship with seven groups of beings:

1. our elders
1. our peers
1. our juniors
1. our elders' enemies
1. our and our peers' enemies
1. our juniors' enemies, and finally
1. neutral people, those who have not helped or harmed us or our loved ones

## guided[^1]

in this meditation practice, we move from a breath-counting technique to contemplation. through repentance and reflection we deepen our compassion.  by practicing this deeper form of contemplation and meditation, we repent our misdeeds, dedicate ourselves to benefit others, and strengthen our own meditation practice. if we practice this contemplation every day, we will soon obtain many benefits: our anger will be replaced by tolerance, our minds will be more at peace, our social interactions will improve, and our friends and foes alike will be more amenable and open to buddhist cultivation. here is a model for this meditation practice.

read the compassion contemplation seven times in the following manner: first read the columns from top to bottom, then  from bottom to top. repeat until you have sincerely read from top to bottom four times and bottom to top three times. during the contemplation, stay focused. do not be distracted such as conjuring the people’s faces in your mind. this counts as one session of the seven-round compassion contemplation.
