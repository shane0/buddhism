# meditation

My meditation is ecclectic (drawn from many sources) and mostly influenced by Hinduism, Buddhism, Zen, Non Duality, Stoicism, etc.

Buddha / Buddhists typically teach there are 84,000 possible ways the mind gets broken and I think I heard Buddha even created that many specific meditation paths?   I can't imagine someone having that much time to write this, or read it, and it's not translated to English yet so I'll leave that for another lifetime lol.

* Mingyur teaches "meditate anytime, anywhere, with anything"[^2]
	* I have always thought meditation sessions are silly, why not train the mind for continuous well being, who cares if I can relax when I have a quiet room and a pillow?  
* Sutta 148 has probably had the biggest impact on me personally[^10] 
	* after this I logically disconnected my sense of self from body sensations, occasionally I was come back to this but for the most part the effect was permanent
* suspend your attention within the nature of non-dual awareness[^6]
	* this is what I'm currently practicing, I'm fairly active when working or when at home with hobbies so it's out of balance, the teaching recommends less doing and more meditating but I'll have to get that that level later in life, I'm not ready for that sacrifics yet

any time i can i'm listening to podcasts, watching videos, reading books and trying the things i learn

this video has the instructions which are also in his books, particularly vajra speech which is a very small portable book which I try to keep in mind always, or carry with me if I'm travelling[^5]

dzogchen is my favorite, non meditation, non distraction, years before i heard of Urgyen i was experimenting with making productivity software and my design was essentially the same as the instructions in this video 

this video is basicaly the same content that are in his books, many of which i read richard gere sponsored
