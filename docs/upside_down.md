- four root wrong views

- **Seeking permanence in a world of impermanence**
- **Seeking happiness in things that are impure**
- **Seeking a self in that which is selfless**
- **Seeking annihilation in that which is not annihilated**

- examples

- **Seeking permanence in a world of impermanence:** If we believe that our relationships, our possessions, or our own sense of self will last forever, we will experience great suffering when they change or disappear.
- **Seeking happiness in things that are impure:** If we believe that material possessions, sensual pleasures, or fame will make us happy, we will be constantly disappointed, because these things are ultimately unsatisfactory.
- **Seeking a self in that which is selfless:** If we believe that we have a fixed, unchanging identity or essence, we will compare ourselves to others and feel envious or resentful. We may also become defensive or avoidant when we are criticized.
- **Seeking annihilation in that which is not annihilated:** If we believe that we will cease to exist at death, we may become anxious or depressed about our own mortality or the mortality of others. We may also lose interest in life or become reckless.

The antidote to the four root wrong views is to develop wisdom and compassion. Wisdom is the understanding of the true nature of reality, which is impermanent, interdependent, and empty of inherent existence. Compassion is the desire to help others who are suffering.

When we have wisdom and compassion, we are able to let go of our attachments and live in peace and harmony with the world around us. We accept that everything changes and that nothing is permanent. We find happiness in the simple things in life, such as our relationships with loved ones and the beauty of nature. We also develop compassion for ourselves and others, knowing that we are all suffering beings.

If you are struggling with any of the four root wrong views, it is important to seek help from a qualified teacher or therapist. They can help you to develop wisdom and compassion and to overcome your attachments.

## other root wrong views

The Buddhist root wrong views are:

- **Eternalism:** The belief that the self or any phenomenon is permanent and unchanging.
- **Annihilationism:** The belief that the self or any phenomenon ceases to exist at death or that there is no afterlife.
- **Personality-view:** The belief that the self has a fixed, unchanging identity or essence.
- **Extreme essentialism:** The belief that phenomena have a fixed, unchanging essence that is separate from their conditioned existence.
- **Nihilism:** The belief that nothing exists or that existence has no inherent meaning or value.

- **Eternalism:** If we believe that the self is permanent and unchanging, we may become attached to our possessions, our relationships, or our own sense of self. When these things change or disappear, we may experience great suffering.
- **Annihilationism:** If we believe that the self ceases to exist at death, we may become anxious or depressed about our own mortality or the mortality of others. We may also lose interest in life or become reckless.
- **Personality-view:** If we believe that the self has a fixed, unchanging identity or essence, we may compare ourselves to others and feel envious or resentful. We may also become defensive or avoidant when we are criticized.
- **Extreme essentialism:** If we believe that phenomena have a fixed, unchanging essence that is separate from their conditioned existence, we may become dogmatic or intolerant of other people's beliefs. We may also become inflexible and unable to adapt to change.
- **Nihilism:** If we believe that nothing exists or that existence has no inherent meaning or value, we may become apathetic or depressed. We may also lose interest in life or become reckless.

It is important to note that the root wrong views are not necessarily harmful or unethical. They are simply misunderstandings of the true nature of reality. However, when we cling to these wrong views, they can lead to suffering for ourselves and others.
