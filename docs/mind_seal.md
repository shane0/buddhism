## Preface

## 1 Cultivators should thus abide and subdue their minds

## 2 Cultivators should abide in nothing to give rise to the mind

## 3 All appearances are illusory

## 4 If even the Dharma should be abandoned, how much more so the non-Dharma?

## 5 The minds of the past, present, and future are ungraspable

## 6 All dharmas are equal

## 7 All saints and sages are distinguished by the unconditioned dharma

## 8 Those who see me in form or seek me through sound are on a mistaken path; they do not see the Tathagata

## appendix Memorial inscription of the life and epitaph of Grand Master Weichueh Zhian, 57th generation of the Linji School, founder of Chung Tai Chan Monastery
