In Buddhism, there are three kinds of sustenance (三資糧 san-zi-liang) for our cultivation: faith (信 xin), vows (願 yuan), and practice (行 xing). Regardless of which one we try to develop, we must have strong resolve. Buddhism also teaches, “Seek the Buddha Way and liberate all sentient beings.” Here, seeking the Buddha Way is the ultimate goal of our cultivation; it requires determination to reach this goal. As for liberating all sentient beings, it is an essential part of cultivating the Bodhisattva Way. So, bodhisattva practitioners must have determination and patience to do it, even though it is not an easy task to guide sentient beings who have different dispositions and capacities. Difficulties are inevitable not only in Buddhist cultivation, but in anything we do. If we hesitate in forging ahead because we are afraid of unknown future obstacles, we will become entwined in a web of fear, indecision and timidity. Then, we will achieve nothing.

In the Tang dynasty, there was a poet, Bai Juyi (白居易; 772-846), who was also an official. When Bai Juyi was the county chief of Qiantang (now Hangzhou), one day, he was passing by the Green Water Bridge at the foot of Mt. Qinwang and saw a group of people surrounding a Chan master to learn the Buddhadharma. Bai Juyi wondered, “Why are there so many people studying the Dharma in such a remote place? This Chan master must be a great cultivator!” Riding his horse towards the crowd, Bai Juyi saw that the Chan master was sitting in a tree and said, “Venerable Master, where you are sitting right now is a very dangerous place!”

This was Chan Master Niaoke (鳥窠禪師; 741-824). Because he was living in a tree, he was known as Niaoke, literally “Bird Nest.” Upon seeing Bai Juyi, Chan Master Niaoke immediately knew he was a self-centered and arrogant high official. So the master replied, “County chief, it is your position that is truly dangerous!” Puzzled, Bai Juyi asked, “My position is to govern this area. How could it be dangerous?” The master answered, “Your situation is like firewood, about to be engulfed by flames, and your clinging consciousness also never stops. When both your body and mind are unstable, how could you not see such imminent danger?” Upon hearing this explanation, Bai Juyi further asked, “Venerable Master, please tell me, what is the essence of the Buddhadharma?” Master Niaoke replied, “Do no evil. Perform all good.” Since Bai Juyi was also familiar with the Dharma, he immediately said, “I’ve known this teaching for a long time. In fact, even a 3-year-old knows it!” Knowing the county chief was looking down on this teaching, Master Niaoke retorted, “A 3-year-old child may know it, but an 80-year-old man cannot follow it.” Hearing this, Bai Juyi felt so ashamed and realized the Chan master had explained a very profound and insightful teaching using simple words. He told the master, “I have come to some realization, and am eager to follow you to learn and practice the Dharma. I will definitely come back to you someday.” Then, he left.

Knowing Bai Juyi had deep virtuous roots, Chan Master Niaoke waited for almost a year. But, Bai Juyi never returned. So, one day, the master paid a visit to his official residence, only to find that Bai Juyi was out socializing. Master Niaoke then left him a poem, saying, “Being an official, you have written case judgments for forty years, deciding myriad rights and wrongs. While one family is well-off and thousands of others are resenting your decisions, your fame and glory of half a lifetime can lead to a hundred lifetimes of misery.” Before long, Bai Juyi returned and saw the poem. It immediately struck a chord with him. For decades, he had longed to cultivate the Way; however, he had not seen through his attachment to people and the daily affairs around him, nor could he let go of worldly troubles and disputes. He was entangled in endless personal grudges. Awakened by the poem, he immediately made great vows and quit his job to follow Master Niaoke for cultivation.

We see many people who cannot put what they know into practice because they have doubts and cannot let go of their attachments. But the moment we see reality as it is and let go of all attachments, we will be brave and decisive enough to practice what we have learned.
