the best concise instructions i've seen are urgyens thought free video and this one - [naturally liberating whatever you meet](https://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/khenpo-gangshar/liberating-whatever-you-meet-concise)

and there are some big nuggets in this one

and a few instructions i would call faith based nihilism

once you get into deep water everyone talks about the "non conceptual", for example saying that we are infinite and eternal, those two experiences in the context of this universe overlap delusion

remember to recognize mind essence: "What is it that imagines this? What is
it that thinks this?"

I'm going to talk a little more about practicing the development
stage as an imitation of the real thing, as a mere resemblance. At some
point in a sadhana there is the mantra 
OM MAHA SHUNYATA JNANA VAJRA SVABHAVA ATMA KOH HANG. 
The syllable OM is the nature of all form, and it expresses 
that everything perceived is Buddha Vairochana, the emptiness of all form. 
MAHA SHUNYATA means great emptiness.
JNANA means original wakefulness, emptiness and cognizance indivisible. In essence, when one recites
In essence, when one recites the mantra one is saying, "I am of the
nature of indestructible wakefulness in which everything perceived is a
great emptiness."
Then, after a few seconds, one says, "From this state of emptiness,
in one instant, I appear in the form of the deity."

There are four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism: 
Kagyii, Sakya, Nyingma and Geluk. In all four of these traditions, when we practice
development stage, we need to start with the samadhi of suchness.
Suchness means the innate nature of your own mind. It is not some
other suchness from some other place. That suchness is simply the
completion stage. The complete in completion means what is completely
present as your own nature, which is the dharmakaya nature of mind.
To recognize that is called completion stage. While recognizing mind
essence, while remaining in the samadhi of suchness, one allows the
visualizations of the development stage to take place without leaving
the natural state behind. Out of the expanse of the three kayas, the
practice of sadhana takes place for the benefit of beings. Both samsara
and nirvana always manifest out of the expanse of the three kayas.
The first of the three samadhis, the samadhi of suchness, means
primordial emptiness. It is actually the essence of the kayas of all
ns 
buddhas. The empty essence is the quality of enlightened body. The
cognizant nature is the quality of enlightened speech. The unconfined
capacity of awareness is the quality of enlightened mind.

I've narrowed down and rearanged the order of the books / practices I'm studying and taking notes, after these notes make sense I will publish them here.

* Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche - several books I've ordered and am reading currently
* Lerab Lingpa - Open Mind
* Dudjom Lingpa - Vajra Essence

## rando notes


* this entie site is a draft, it grows then shrinks regularly as i attempt to grasp this subject
	* i've only studied buddhism for a few years and specifically dzogchen, amazon sells 700 books on dzogchen, that is far too many so my main goal with this project is to sift through and find the most meaningful and see if i can achieve the claims people make for it in this lifetime
	* wish me luck ‚ù§
* checkout the [centre for contemplate research](https://www.centerforcontemplativeresearch.org/)
* my **[daily habits](dzogchen/daily.html)**
* **[deity research](dzogchen/deities.html)**
* **Vajrayana can end widespread ignorance and replace it with compassion & enlightenment**
* **life is an energy too,  until scientific equations factor it in we will continue to learn more about dead particles than live ones**

dwelling nowhere the mind comes forth
awaken your mind without fixing it anywhere 
you must separate no form from form
```

1. [ngondro](dzogchen/ngondro.md) is a tibetan word that translates to first steps and foundational, i practice that and read books on ngondro
1. [dhogzhen](dzogchen/index.md)  is tibetan for great perfection, or greatest completion, it extends ngondro even further towards wisdom and compassion, for all beings
