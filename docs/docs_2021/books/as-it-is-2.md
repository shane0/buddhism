# as it is - vol 2

tulku urgyen rinpoche (richard gere helped fund this publishing)

covers the second stage called **dzogrim** aka completion stage[^2] which is more about the non conceptual

urgyen is the father of mingyur whose book [confusion-to-clarity](confusion-to-clarity.md) which I recommend reading first 

i'm reading this book currently, preceded by [as it is vol 1](as-it-is.md) and will be followed by (i have not decided)

if you have difficulty understanding emptiness when this book, someone recommended the book "Emptiness" by Guy Armstrong
