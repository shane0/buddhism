## practice

the actual practice is sort of hidden inside the paragraphs i need to review and highlight them to make sure i have it, also watching his playist on youtube from a shamatha retreat

### shamatha

[see shamatha page](shamatha.md)
* relax the mind probe awareness
* settle the mind without distraction or grasping

basically you have to achieve shamatha first, that is apareantly a rare long involved thing to achieve fully, if you do you can for example stand for 24 hours calmly and are rarely disturbed by any circumstance for example someone could clash cymbols near you and you wouldn't be phased, etc.

### vipassana

* can be broken up into sections, mind, body, etc. instead of doing shamatha with objects or without objects you do it with whatever arises internally or externally

overall though you're fully relaxed with shamatha then let things arise naturally without judging them or commenting on them, simply remain aware and in the moment fully relaxed

the deep realization is nearly everything is impermanent, including self, objects, etc. so you no longer live in the desire realm you dive deeper into reality that ignores the waves and is the ocean which consists of bliss, luminosity, awareness with names like rigpa, pristine awareness, substrate consciousness, primordial awareness, etc. 

non conceptual, no conceptual elaboration, this isn't something you can really discuss with words which cannot capture the energies that are revealed

there are some things that can happen that are supernatural, esp, etc. gods, demons, visions, etc. but these are typically nyams, just more things arising to be aware of without attachment


## jargon

nyam - meditation experiences - wide variety, emotions, bindus, rainboy light, esp

togpa - different from nyams, these are realization

	If we look at the Dharma from another perspective, we can say that it has two aspects: tradition and experience. Tradition, known as lung [lung] in Tibetan, is the authority, transmission, or legacy of the teachings. Experience, or togpa [rtogs pa] in Tibetan, is the practice or application of the Dharma. Both of these aspects of the Dharma are oriented toward bringing about a positive change in our mind.

vidyadhara (Skt). One who has gained a conceptually unmediated, nondual realization of rigpa, of buddha nature. vipashyana (Skt). Contemplative insight
bought this book on 2020-08-05 and taking notes on it here

this book expounds on dudjom lingpa's vajra essence shamatha instructions

## instructions

shamatha translates to calm abiding

abide in the mind which is naturally calm regardless surrounding circumstances

master shamatha and you'll be able to focus on vipassana where you cut through the ego mind's grasping at physical objects which are empty

you are watching the mind, letting it settle to it's natural still state, this is best done on retreats in the woods

you find optimal muscular and mental tension, you do not just flop on the ground completely relaxing all muscles you want to find a balance where your muscles only have the tension required for whatever position you're using

one of alans videos says there are 9 levels, trying to find where these are in the book - [9 ways](https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Nine_ways_of_resting_the_mind)

1. with objects
1. without objects
1. visualizing buddhas? 


## mind arises with dependancies




1. chitta (sanskrit) psyche emerges from what Sogyal Rinpoche calls the “ground of the ordinary mind.” 
1. alayavijñana (sanskrit) is translated as the “substrate consciousness.” (This corresponds closely to the Theravada Buddhist term bhavanga, or “ground of becoming.”) 
1. rigpa dharmakaya buddhahood <-- accessed by practicing shamathat


## eight consciousnesses

dhogzhen expands the 5/6 senses to 8

1. vision
