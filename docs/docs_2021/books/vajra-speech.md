# vajra speech

I read [vajra speech](http://www.rangjung.com/book_title/vajra-speech/) in 2021, preceded by [fathoming the mind](fathoming.md) and followed by [as it is vol 1](as-it-is.md)

this is one of my favorites, this book is best understood by watching the video below

this is a good travel book, smaller sized

the information is a collection of summaries on topics that are in alphabetical order

you could just pickup this book, choose any topic, and use it to guide a meditate
