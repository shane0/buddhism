this is a microsite with my research on meditation, buddhism, minimalism, hindusim and related subjects.

my goal is to maintain meditative awareness levels at all times, not just when i'm on a cushion in a shrine

throughout the day i try to [recognize rigpa](sadhana/urgyen.md), some call this non meditation.

i do the same slightly differently when i go to [sleep](https://shanenull.com/buddhism/cognizance/buddhism%20projects/dream%20yoga/dream_as_it_is/) 

this site has some old notes i need to clean up

currently i'm reading & taking notes on the book [as it is vol 1](books/as-it-is.md)
