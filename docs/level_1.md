### comments on the format

- this is preparation for having continuous mindful state in life not just on the cushion
- in meditation you train your mind new habits
- a bell or wood block are used to signal transitions which helps shift the mind to a non conceptual state
- you can use things referred to as supports in meditation, several are used in this format
- when sitting be still, when in action be focused and efficient
- supports serve different purposes
- chanting purifies speech and trains your mind to concentrate without distraction
- after chanting ou sit in silence and you can use the breath for a support
- or you can contemplate the information from the chant
- if you are using the breath as a support you can adjust your breath counting or other methods to align the mind accordingly
- after sitting you strech and then walk
- as you transition from one format to another you maintain un distracted pure awareness
