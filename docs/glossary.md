Determining the exact origin of the Diamond Sutra is a complex topic with some uncertainty. Here's what we know:

**Language and Tradition:**

- The original text was likely composed in **Sanskrit**, the liturgical language of early Buddhism.
- It belongs to the **Mahayana Buddhist tradition**, specifically the Prajnaparamita branch focused on "Perfection of Wisdom" teachings.

**Timeline and Location:**

- **Estimated Composition:** Most scholars place the composition of the Diamond Sutra somewhere between the **2nd and 5th centuries CE**.
- **Earliest Existing Sanskrit Version:** The earliest known fragmented Sanskrit manuscript dates back to the **3rd-4th centuries CE**.
- **First Chinese Translation:** The first known Chinese translation appeared in the early **5th century CE**.

**Specific Origin:**

- **Pinpointing the exact location** of the sutra's origin within India is **still debated**. Some theories suggest it originated in northwestern India, while others point to southern regions.
- **Attributing authorship** to a specific individual is also **difficult**, as Mahayana texts often circulated anonymously and evolved through oral transmission before being written down.

## Unconditioned Dharma

- chapter 7 no attainment no teaching

The world as perceived by unenlightened people is conditioned, changing and relative, which leads to suffering.

The enlightened beings are able to transcend conditioned existence and arrive at the unconditioned shore, which is to attain nirvana.

To understand the unconditioned dharma is to realize nirvana.

Saints and sages are distinguished by the different levels of their realizations of the unconditioned dharma.

of the triple world.

## Sakridagamin

ness of the ego-self and eradicated all afflictions of the triple world,
and therefore is no longer subject to rebirth.

## Samadhi

## mindfulness practice

Mindfulness is a state of mind. To practice mindfulness means that the mind is
conscientious, clear and lucid. Thoughts of greed and anger are quickly detected and
renounced, and eventually, only righteous thoughts arise.

The mind thinks of the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the precepts; the mind is filled with
compassion; the mind is not deluded and misguided.

By practice in right mindfulness, we eventually have a complete understanding of the Dharma, are willing to do all good
without a sense of the "self" doing the deed, or the "other" benefiting from the deed,
finally reaching enlightenment.

## Thirty-two good marks

- chapter 13

> The thirty-two good marks
>> are distinctive bodily characteristics of a great being, particularly a buddha or a wheel-turning sage king (see footnote 48 for more on wheel-turning sage king). As lay people, those endowed with the thirty-two good marks will be wheel-turning sage kings. If they renounce home life to practice the Dharma, they will achieve enlightenment and become buddhas. Although there are different sets of the thirty-two good marks given in the sutras, all these good marks are said to be effects resulted by upholding pure precepts and performing wholesome deeds.

## buddha eyes

- chapter 18

The physical eye, deva eye, wisdom eye, dharma eye, and buddha eye W All BIE A bId.

According to the Mahaprajnaparamita Shastra (translated into Chinese by Kumarajiva), the physical eye can see what is close to us but not what is far away; can see what is in front of us but not what is behind; can see in the daytime but not in the nighttime.

To go beyond these limitations of the physical eye, the deva eye is needed.

Those who have the deva eye can see near and far, what is in the front and back, and during the daytime and the nighttime.

Although seeing through the appearance of what is dependently arising, they have not seen the empty nature of all beings and phenomena yet.

It is only those with the wisdom eye who can see the truth of emptiness, and with this wisdom of emptiness, they relinquish all attachments.

But because of immersing in emptiness, they have not yet developed expedient means to liberate sentient beings, which requires the dharma eye to do so.

In addition to emptiness, those who have the dharma eye realize the worldly truth and thus establish all dharmas according to conditions.

Consequently, they use expedient means in accordance with the needs of sentient beings to help them on the path to buddhahood.

To perfect the application of expedient means to liberate all sentient beings, the buddha eye is indispensable.

Buddhas with their buddha eyes see through all beings and phenomena, their differences as well as their common nature.

Put it in another way, the buddha eye clearly sees the ultimate truth of middle way reality.
