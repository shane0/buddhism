The Prajñāpāramitā literature is extensive and includes various sutras of different lengths, emphasizing the perfection of wisdom and the concept of emptiness. While there isn't a single sutra that comprehensively covers all aspects of Prajñāpāramitā teachings, there are several key texts within the genre. Some of the most notable ones include:

Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (The Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines):

This sutra is one of the longer Prajñāpāramitā texts and provides extensive teachings on emptiness and the Bodhisattva path.
Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (The Perfection of Wisdom in 25,000 Lines):

Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (The Diamond Sutra):
