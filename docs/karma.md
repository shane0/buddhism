> WE ARE SO IGNORANT OF KARMA â€” Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche
>> Although we are responsible for what we sow, we forget that we've planted these seeds and either give credit to or blame people or things outside of us when they ripen. ... In the moment, we have a thought, we speak or act. But we lose sight of the fact that each thought, word, and action will pro- duce a result. When the fruit finally ripens, we think, "Why did this happen to me? I've done nothing to deserve this."
