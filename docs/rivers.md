# four rivers of natural suffering

Shakyamuni Buddha spoke of four rivers of natural suffering:

1. Birth
2. Aging
3. Sickness
4. Death

The four natural suffering are inevitable difficulties of life. But they can be experienced without extras, without compounding the suffering with story lines that solidify our misperceptions about reality. There is a teaching take form the Buddhaâ€™s time that makes this point.
