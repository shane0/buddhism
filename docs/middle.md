Dependent Origination: The second pillar is dependent origination, which is the principle that all phenomena arise and cease to exist in dependence on other phenomena.
Tathagata Nature: The third pillar is Tathagata Nature, which is the true nature of all beings. It is a nature that is pure, perfect, and luminous.

Linji often used the term "Middle Way" to refer to this state of reality. He said that the Middle Way is not a place or a thing, but a state of mind. It is the state of mind that is free from attachment and aversion, and that sees things as they really are.

The Middle Way is also sometimes called "suchness" or "tathata" in Mahayana Buddhism. Suchness is the ultimate reality, the true nature of things. It is beyond all concepts and words, and can only be experienced directly.

Linji's teachings on the Middle Way are based on the Buddhist concept of emptiness. Emptiness is the absence of inherent existence, or the idea that things do not have any independent reality. According to Linji, all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, and this includes the self.

When we realize the emptiness of the self, we free ourselves from attachment and aversion. We no longer see ourselves as separate from the world, and we are able to experience reality directly, without any conceptualizations.

The Middle Way is a difficult state to achieve, but it is the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice. It is the state of liberation from suffering and confusion, and the state of true happiness.

Here are some of the ways that Linji taught his students to realize the Middle Way:

Meditation: Meditation is a practice that can help us to calm the mind and to see things more clearly.
Koans: Koans are paradoxical riddles that can help us to break through our conceptualizations and to see reality directly.
Studying sutras: Studying sutras can help us to understand the teachings of the Buddha and to develop wisdom.
Direct experience: The ultimate way to realize the Middle Way is through direct experience. This can be done through meditation, koan introspection, or other spiritual practices.
The Middle Way is a profound and challenging concept, but it is the key to liberation from suffering and confusion. If we are willing to put in the effort, we can all realize the Middle Way and experience the true nature of reality.
