# food

a little prayer to say before eating, we are omnivoires & we depend on all life in this ecosystem

so we should show appreciation for it, each other & be grateful for everything from the air & water to the creatures & plants we consume

```text
Aum... Aum... Aum
Sahana vavatu sahanau bhunaktu
Sahaveeryam karavavahai
TejasvinavadhitamastuMavid
visha vahai Aum...
Shanti Shanti Shantihi

Let us be together.
Let us eat together.
Let us produce energy together.
Let there be no limit to our energies.
Let there be no ill-feeling among us.
Aum... Peace, Peace, Peace.
```

I don't know where this is from but it's ancient I'm sure, I first read it in "A taste of Well-Being"
