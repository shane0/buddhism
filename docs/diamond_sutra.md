> Prajna Paramita (Skt.)
>> Great transcendental wisdom, wisdom of understanding the empty nature of the self and all phenomena, which can overcome birth and death and all suffering, as well as enlighten all beings. Paramita literally means "to the other shore." The six paramitas (perfections) are practiced by bodhisattvas to attain buddhahood; they are perfections of charity (dana), moral conduct (shila), tolerance (kshanti), diligence (virya), meditation (dhyana), and most important of all, wisdom (prajna).

## 1 | The Core of Mahayana Practice

The Buddha said to Subhuti, "The bodhisattvas and maha-sattvas should thus subdue their minds: All the different types of sentient beings's
—whether they are born from eggs,
from wombs, from moisture, or by transformation;" whether they have form or no form; whether they have thoughts or no thoughts, or have neither thought nor non-thought' - I will liberate them, by leading them to nirvana without residue! When immeasurable, countless, infinite sentient beings have been liberated, ultimately, no sentient beings have been liberated. Why? Subhuti, if bodhisattvas have any notions of a self, a person, a sentient being or a life span, they are not bodhisattvas."

Subhuti, if a person were to fill countless worlds with the seven jewels and give them away in charity, and if a good man or good woman, having made the bodhisattva resolve, reads, recites, studies, follows and expounds to others this sutra, even a mere four-line verse, the latter's merits far exceed the former's. How should one expound to others?
Without attachment, abiding in stillness and suchness. Why?

All conditioned dharmas
Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, Like dew or a flash of lightning;
Thus we shall perceive them.
With this, the Buddha concluded the sutra. The elder Subhuti, other bhikshus, bhikshunis, upasakas, upasikas," heavenly and human beings, asuras and other beings of the world, having heard the Buddha, were all filled with immense joy; they accepted and followed the teaching faith-fully.

## The Diamond Sutra: An Outline

The Diamond Sutra, or Vajracchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra, is a Mahayana Buddhist sutra that emphasizes the importance of emptiness (shunyata) and prajnaparamita, the perfection of wisdom. It is considered to be one of the most important sutras in Mahayana Buddhism, and it has been studied and commented on by countless Buddhist scholars and practitioners over the centuries.

The Diamond Sutra is divided into 32 chapters, each of which deals with a different aspect of emptiness and prajnaparamita. The sutra is a dialogue between the Buddha and his disciple Subhuti, and it explores the nature of reality, the self, and the path to enlightenment.

- Key Themes

Emptiness: The Diamond Sutra teaches that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, meaning that they do not exist independently of other phenomena. This does not mean that phenomena do not exist at all; it simply means that they exist in a state of dependent origination.

Prajnaparamita: Prajnaparamita is the wisdom that sees the true nature of reality, which is emptiness. It is the antidote to ignorance, which is the root cause of suffering.

Non-attachment: The Diamond Sutra teaches that we should not be attached to anything, including our own bodies, minds, and thoughts. This is because attachment is the source of suffering.

The Middle Way: The Diamond Sutra teaches the Middle Way, which is the path that avoids the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification. The Middle Way is the path to enlightenment.

- Conclusion

The Diamond Sutra is a profound and complex text that has been interpreted in many different ways. However, at its heart, the sutra is a message of liberation. It teaches us that we can be free from suffering by understanding the true nature of reality.
