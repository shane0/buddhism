## notes

> Prajna Paramita (Skt.)
>> Great transcendental wisdom, wisdom of understanding the empty nature of the self and all phenomena, which can overcome birth and death and all suffering, as well as enlighten all beings. Paramita literally means "to the other shore." The six paramitas (perfections) are practiced by bodhisattvas to attain buddhahood; they are perfections of charity (dana), moral conduct (shila), tolerance (kshanti), diligence (virya), meditation (dhyana), and most important of all, wisdom (prajna).

## 32 | All Dharmas Are Illusions

> "Subhuti, if a person were to fill countless worlds with the seven jewels and give them away in charity, and if a good man or good woman, having made the bodhisattva resolve, reads, recites, studies, follows and expounds to others this sutra, even a mere four-line verse, the latter's merits far exceed the former's. How should one expound to others?  Without attachment, abiding in stillness and suchness. Why?
>> All conditioned dharmas Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, Like dew or a flash of lightning; Thus we shall perceive them.  With this, the Buddha concluded the sutra. The elder Subhuti, other bhikshus, bhikshunis, upasakas, upasikas," heavenly and human beings, asuras and other beings of the world, having heard the Buddha, were all filled with immense joy; they accepted and followed the teaching faith-fully.

## The Diamond Sutra: An Outline

The Diamond Sutra, or Vajracchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra, is a Mahayana Buddhist sutra that emphasizes the importance of emptiness (shunyata) and prajnaparamita, the perfection of wisdom. It is considered to be one of the most important sutras in Mahayana Buddhism, and it has been studied and commented on by countless Buddhist scholars and practitioners over the centuries.

The Diamond Sutra is divided into 32 chapters, each of which deals with a different aspect of emptiness and prajnaparamita. The sutra is a dialogue between the Buddha and his disciple Subhuti, and it explores the nature of reality, the self, and the path to enlightenment.

- Key Themes

Emptiness: The Diamond Sutra teaches that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, meaning that they do not exist independently of other phenomena. This does not mean that phenomena do not exist at all; it simply means that they exist in a state of dependent origination.

Prajnaparamita: Prajnaparamita is the wisdom that sees the true nature of reality, which is emptiness. It is the antidote to ignorance, which is the root cause of suffering.

Non-attachment: The Diamond Sutra teaches that we should not be attached to anything, including our own bodies, minds, and thoughts. This is because attachment is the source of suffering.

The Middle Way: The Diamond Sutra teaches the Middle Way, which is the path that avoids the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification. The Middle Way is the path to enlightenment.

- Conclusion

The Diamond Sutra is a profound and complex text that has been interpreted in many different ways. However, at its heart, the sutra is a message of liberation. It teaches us that we can be free from suffering by understanding the true nature of reality.

## first sanskrit version

Determining the exact age and location of the oldest Sanskrit version of the Diamond Sutra can be a bit tricky, as fragments of multiple early manuscripts have been discovered in different locations. However, here's what we know:

- **Earliest Fragments:** The currently known oldest fragments of a Sanskrit Diamond Sutra are believed to date back to the **3rd-4th centuries CE**. These fragments were discovered in **Gilgit, Pakistan**, located in the northwestern Indian subcontinent.
- **Incomplete Manuscripts:** These fragments don't represent the entire text, only parts of individual chapters. This makes it difficult to definitively date the complete original version.
- **Multiple Locations:** Fragments of early Sanskrit Diamond Sutras have also been found in other locations like **Khotan, Xinjiang**, and **Central Asia**, suggesting wider circulation and potential for earlier versions existing.

Therefore, while **Gilgit fragments** currently represent the oldest known parts of a Sanskrit Diamond Sutra, the precise location and date of the complete original text, and whether older versions might exist somewhere, remain open questions for further research and discovery.

If you're interested in learning more about specific early manuscripts or ongoing research in this area, I'd be happy to share any additional details I can find!
