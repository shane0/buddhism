> Prajna Paramita (Skt.)
>> Great transcendental wisdom, wisdom of understanding the empty nature of the self and all phenomena, which can overcome birth and death and all suffering, as well as enlighten all beings. Paramita literally means "to the other shore." The six paramitas (perfections) are practiced by bodhisattvas to attain buddhahood; they are perfections of charity (dana), moral conduct (shila), tolerance (kshanti), diligence (virya), meditation (dhyana), and most important of all, wisdom (prajna).
