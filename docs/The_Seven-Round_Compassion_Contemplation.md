taught in Chapter 2

another teaching and practice to help develop our compassion

This contemplation includes seven rounds.

Each round has seven steps to reflect upon our relationship with seven groups of beings:

1. our elders
2. our peers
3. our juniors
4. our elders' enemies
5. our and our peers' enemies
6. our juniors' enemies, and finally
7. neutral people, those who have not helped or harmed us or our loved ones
