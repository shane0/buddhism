- these my favorite sources for books that free and online
- some also have audio or video
- there is one I cannot find for free that can be found used for $30

## BDK

- BDK stands for Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai, which translates to the Society for the Promotion of Buddhism

## BTTS

- Buddhist Text Translation Society (BTTS)

## suggested approach

- Heart of the Buddha's Teaching - Thich Nhat Hanh audiobook or epub
- there are some unique approaches found in this book that are in no other sources
- <https://plumvillage.org/books/the-heart-of-the-buddhas-teaching>
- the heart sutra is a summary of the diamond sutra which is a summary of the full prajna paramita
- the heart sutra is one page takes minutes
- the diamond sutra is 32 chapters takes around an hour
- which is a summary of the full prajna paramita takes lifetimes
- more on the full prajna paramita <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajnaparamita>

## cormac mccarthy

- I also recommend all of cormac mccarthy's books
- they are not explicitly buddhism but they might as well be in my opinion
