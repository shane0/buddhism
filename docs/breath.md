# counting the breath

- set your posture firm but not tense
- take 3 deep relaxing breaths
- relax the body
- when breathing in or out, note mindfully in or out
- breathe relaxed and natural, do not force it
- whenever you breathe out, start counting upwards
- stop counting when the out breath is finished
- this number you use count on subsequent out breaths

## tips

- use right mindfulness[^1]
- maintain awareness of observation[^2]
- if the conscious mind[^1] distracts you, use reflective awareness[^1] and return to counting
