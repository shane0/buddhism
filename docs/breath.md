# counting the breath

- prep posture body breath mind
- remove shoes
  
- breath naturally, no need to force anything

- breath in knowing you are breating in
- breath out knowing you are breating out

- breath in knowing you are breating
- breath out counting 1,2,3... however far out breath takes
- repeat this, if it becomes consistent that is good

- breath in 1
- breath out 1
- breath in 2
- breath out 2
- continue, to a number you are comfortable with
- if you become distracted simply start over

- once you are confident counting the breath you can stop counting
- simply breath and remain mindful

- end gently massage head to toe
- put on shoes transition to walking meditation
