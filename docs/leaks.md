# leaks

the concept of the leaks is mentioned in many different suttas

* **Samyutta Nikaya 3.16:** This sutta describes the eight worldly winds, which are prosperity, decline, disgrace, honor, praise, censure, suffering, and pleasure. The Buddha teaches that the eight worldly winds are like leaks that can cause us to suffer if we are not careful. When we are mindful of the eight worldly winds and develop wisdom and compassion, we can avoid being blown away by them and we can be free from suffering.

* **Samyutta Nikaya 3.17:** This sutta describes the three leaks, which are attachment to form, attachment to sensation, and attachment to perception. The Buddha teaches that the three leaks are the root of all suffering. When we let go of our attachments to form, sensation, and perception, we can be free from suffering.

* **Majjhima Nikaya 141:** This sutta describes the six gateways to the three leaks, which are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Buddha teaches that the six gateways are the avenues through which the three leaks enter our minds. When we are mindful of the six gateways and we train our minds to be calm and focused, we can close the doors to the three leaks and we can be free from suffering.

* **Anguttara Nikaya 5.140:** This sutta describes the four ways to overcome the three leaks, which are through mindfulness, investigation, wisdom, and liberation. The Buddha teaches that when we are mindful of the three leaks, we can investigate them and see their true nature. When we have wisdom, we can understand that the three leaks are impermanent and that they do not define who we are. When we are liberated from the three leaks, we are free from suffering.
