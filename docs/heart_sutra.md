bodhisattva avalokiteshvara
while deeply immersed in prajna paramita
clearly perceived the empty nature of the five skandhas
and transcended all suffering
shariputra form is not different from emptiness
emptiness is not different from form
form is emptiness
emptiness is form
so it is with feeling conception volition and consciousness
shariputra all dharmas are empty in character
neither arising nor ceasing
neither impure nor pure
neither increasing nor decreasing
therefore in emptiness
there is no form
there is no feeling conception volition or consciousness
no eye ear nose tongue body or mind
no form sound smell taste touch or dharmas
no realm of vision and so forth
up to no realm of mind consciousness
no ignorance or ending of ignorance and so forth
up to no aging and death or ending of aging and death
there is no suffering no cause no extinction no path
there is no wisdom and no attainment
there is nothing to be attained by way of prajna paramita
the bodhisattva's mind is free from hindrances
with no hindrances there is no fear
freed from all distortion and delusion ultimate nirvana is reached
by way of prajna paramita buddhas of the past present and future 
attain anuttara samyak sambodhi
therefore prajna paramita is the great powerful mantra
the great enlightening mantra
the supreme and peerless mantra
it can remove all suffering
this is the truth beyond all doubt
and the prajna paramita mantra is spoken thus
gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha
```

### first letters for memorization

- print this out and carry it
- these are the first letters of each line
