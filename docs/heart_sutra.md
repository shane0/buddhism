---

The short title of this most popular and important sutra.

It contains the very essence of the vast body of the Prajna Paramita Sutras in Buddhism.

---

> prajna (Skt.)
>> Great transcendental wisdom; wisdom of understanding the empty nature of the "self" and all phenomena, which can overcome birth-and-death and all suffering, as well as enlighten all beings.

---

> paramita (Skt.)
>> Literally, "to the other shore." The six paramitas (perfections) are practiced by bodhisattvas to attain buddhahood: perfection of charity (dana), moral conduct (shila), tolerance (kshanti), diligence (virya), meditation (dhyana), and most import- ant of all, wisdom (prajna), which brings true liberation.
