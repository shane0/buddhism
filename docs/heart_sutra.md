---

The short title of this most popular and important sutra.

It contains the very essence of the vast body of the Prajna Paramita Sutras in Buddhism.

---

> prajna (Skt.)
>> Great transcendental wisdom; wisdom of understanding the empty nature of the "self" and all phenomena, which can overcome birth-and-death and all suffering, as well as enlighten all beings.

---

> paramita (Skt.)
>> Literally, "to the other shore." The six paramitas (perfections) are practiced by bodhisattvas to attain buddhahood: perfection of charity (dana), moral conduct (shila), tolerance (kshanti), diligence (virya), meditation (dhyana), and most import- ant of all, wisdom (prajna), which brings true liberation.

## seven jewels

The seven jewels mentioned in the Heart Sutra are symbolic representations of the seven virtues that lead to enlightenment. These virtues are:

1. **The Jewel of the Wheel of Dharma:** This represents the teachings of the Buddha, which guide us on the path to enlightenment.

2. **The Jewel of the Jewel of the Sword of Wisdom:** This represents the wisdom that cuts through ignorance and delusion.

3. **The Jewel of the Jewel of the Great Stupa of Selflessness:** This represents the virtue of selflessness, which is essential for breaking free from the cycle of suffering.

4. **The Jewel of the Jewel of the Great Mirror of Equality:** This represents the mirror-like wisdom that reflects the true nature of reality, which is empty of inherent existence.

5. **The Jewel of the Jewel of the Great Seal of Distinction:** This represents the distinction between wisdom and ignorance, which is essential for understanding the true nature of reality.

6. **The Jewel of the Jewel of the Great Lion's Roar:** This represents the sound of the Buddha's teachings, which awaken us from the sleep of ignorance.

7. **The Jewel of the Jewel of the Great Cloud of Dharma:** This represents the boundless and immeasurable nature of the Dharma, which can benefit all beings.

These seven jewels are not literal objects, but rather symbolic representations of the qualities that we need to cultivate in order to achieve enlightenment. By striving to embody these virtues, we can gradually purify our minds and progress on the path to liberation.
