THAY’S COMMENTARY EXPLAINING HIS NEW TRANSLATION TO HIS STUDENTS

Reasons for Retranslating the Heart Sutra

Dear Family,

The reason Tay must retranslate the Heart Sutra is because the patriarch who originally
recorded the Heart Sutra was not sufficiently skilful enough with his use of language. For this
reason, it has caused much misunderstanding for almost 2,000 years.

Tay would like to share with you two stories: the story of a novice monk that paid a visit to a
Zen master, and the story of a Bhikkhu who came with a question to the Eminent Master Tue
Trung.

In the first story, the Zen master asked the novice monk:

Tell me about your understanding of the Heart sutra.

The novice monk joined his palms and replied:

I have understood that the fve skandhas are empty. Tere are no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body
or mind; there are no forms, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings, or objects of mind; the six
consciousnesses do not exist, the eighteen realms of phenomena do not exist, the twelve links of
dependent arising do not exist, and even wisdom and attainment do not exist.

Do you believe what it says?

Yes, I truly believe what it says.

Come closer to me,  the Zen master instructed the novice monk. When the novice monk
drew near, the Zen master immediately used his thumb and index finger to pinch and twist the
novice's nose.

In great agony, the novice cried out  Teacher! You're hurting me!  The Zen master looked at the
novice.  Just now you said that the nose doesn't exist. But if the nose doesn't exist then what's
hurting?

Te Eminent Master Tue Trung was a lay Zen master who had once served as the mentor for
the young King Tran Nhan Tong, in 13th Century Vietnam. One day, a Bhikkhu paid him a
visit to ask him about the Heart Sutra.

Respected Eminent Master, what does the phrase 'form is emptiness, emptiness is form,' really
mean?

At frst the Eminent Master remained silent. And then, after a while, he asked:
 Bhikkhu, do you have a body?

Yes, I do.

Ten, why do you say that the body does not exist?

The Eminent Master then continued,  Do you think that in empty space there is form?

No, I do not see that there is form.

Ten why do you say that emptiness is form?

The Bhikkhu stood up, bowed, and went on his way. But the Master summoned him back in
order to recite to him the following gatha:

Form is emptiness, emptiness is form,
is a skillful means created temporarily by the Buddhas of the three times.
Emptiness is not form, form is not emptiness -

Their nature is always pure and illuminating, neither caught in being nor in non-being.
In this story the Eminent Master Tue Trung seems to contradict the Heart Sutra and challenge
the sacred formula 'form is emptiness and emptiness is form,' considered inviolable in the
Prajñāpāramitā literature.

Thay believes that the Eminent Master went too far. Te Master was not able to see that the
mistake doesn't rest in the formula, 'form is emptiness' rather, it resides in the unskillfulness of
the line, 'Terefore in emptiness there is no form.' According to Tay, the way in which words are
used in the Heart Sutra, right from the beginning up to the line: 'no birth, no death, not defled,
not immaculate, not increasing, nor decreasing,' is already perfect. Tay’s only regret is that the
patriarch who recorded the Heart Sutra did not add the four words 'no being, no non-being'
immediately after the four words 'no birth, no death,' because these four words would help us
transcend the notion of being and non-being, and we would no longer get caught in such ideas
as 'no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue…' Te nose of the novice monk is still sore, even today. Do
you understand?

The problem begins with the line: 'Listen Shariputra, because in emptiness, there is no form,
feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness' (in Sanskrit:
TasmācŚāriputraśūnyatayāmnarūpamnavedanānasamjñānasamskārānavijñānam).

How funny!

It was previously stated that emptiness is form, and form is emptiness, but now you say the
opposite: there is only emptiness, there is no body.

This line of the sutra can lead to many
damaging misunderstandings. It removes all phenomena from the category 'being' and places
them into the category of 'non-being' (no form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations or
consciousness...).

Yet the true nature of all phenomena is the nature of no being nor non-being,
no birth and no death.

The view of 'being' is one extreme view and the view of 'non-being' is
another extreme view. It is because of this unskilfulness that the novice monk's nose is still sore.
Te famous gatha ascribed to the sixth patriarch Hue Nang (Hui-neng), in which he presented
his insight to the ffth patriarch Hoang Nhan (Hung-jen), also expresses this notion and is also
caught in the same wrong view:

Originally, there is no Bodhi tree

Te bright mirror does not exist either

From the non-beginning of time nothing has ever existed

So where can the dust settle?

A white cloud passes by and hides the mouth of the cave

Causing so many birds to lose their way home.

The insight of prajñāpāramitā is the most liberating insight that helps us overcome all pairs of
opposites such as birth and death, being and non-being, deflement and immaculacy, increasing
and decreasing, subject and object, and so on, and helps us to get in touch with the true nature
of no birth/no death, no being/no non-being etc… which is the true nature of all phenomena.

This is a state of coolness, peace, and non-fear that can be experienced in this very life, in your
own body and in your own fve skandhas.

It is nirvana. Just as the birds enjoy the sky, and the deer
enjoy the meadow, so do the wise enjoy dwelling in nirvana.

This is a very beautiful sentence in the Nirvana Chapter of the Chinese Dharmapada.

The insight of prajñāpāramitā is the ultimate truth, transcending of all conventional truths. It is
the highest vision of the Buddha.

Whatever paragraph in the Tripitaka, even in the most impressive of the Prajñāpāramitā collections, if it so contradicts this, it is still caught in conventional truth.

Unfortunately, in the Heart Sutra we fnd such a paragraph, and it is quite long.

That is why in this new translation Tay has changed the way of using words in both the original Sanskrit and the Chinese translation by Huyen Trang (Xuan-Zang).

Thay translates as follows: 'Tat is why in emptiness, body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness
are not separate self entities.' All phenomena are products of dependent arising: that is the main point of the prajñāpāramitā teaching.

'Even insight and attainment do not exist as separate self entities.'

This sentence is as important as the sentence 'form is emptiness.' Tay also has added 'no being, no non-being' into the text.

No being, no non-being is the deep vision of the Buddha stated in the Kātyāyana sutra, when he offered a defnition on right view. These four words, no being, no non-being, will help future generations not to suffer from a twisted nose.

The Heart Sutra was intended to help the Sarvāstivādins relinquish the view of no self and no
dharma.

The deepest teaching of Prājñāpāramitā is the emptiness of self (ātmaśūnyatā) and the emptiness of dharma (dharmanairātmya) and not the non-being of self and dharma.

Te Buddha has taught in the Kātyāyana sutra that most people in the world are caught either in the view of being and non-being.

Therefore, the sentence 'in emptiness there is no form, feelings...' is obviously still caught in the view of non-being.

That is why this sentence does not correspond to the Ultimate Truth. Emptiness of self only means the emptiness of self, not the non-being of self, just as a balloon that is empty inside does not mean that the balloon does not exist.

The same is true with the emptiness of dharma: it only means the emptiness of all phenomena and not the non-existence of phenomena.

It is like a flower that is made only of non-fower elements. Te fower is empty of a separate existence, but that doesn't mean that the fower is not there.

 Th Heart Sutra made a late appearance at a time when Tantric Buddhism had begun to flourish.

The patriarch who compiled the Heart Sutra wanted to encourage followers of Tantric Buddhism to practice and recite the Heart Sutra, so that's why he presented the Heart Sutra as a kind of mantra.

This was also a skillful means.

Tay has used the phrase, 'The Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore,' because in the mantra there is the expression pāraga Th which means 'gone over to the other shore, the shore of wisdom'.

Pārāyana and pāramitā have both been translated as 'crossing over to the other shore.'

In the Sutta Nipāta there is a chapter called Pārāyana which has also been translated as 'crossing over to the other shore.'

Dear Family, I hope you enjoy practicing the new version of the Heart Sutra in English.

We have an English translation and Br. Phap Linh is in the process of composing the music for the new chant.

The next edition of the Chanting Book will include this new translation.

Yesterday, on the 21st of August, after finishing the translation at around 3a.m., a moon ray penetrated
