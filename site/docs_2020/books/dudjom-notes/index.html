<p>dudjom lingpa says it's much more like a shepherd watching his flock out in an open plain while the shepherd sit still while the flock moves hither and yon and so that cognitive fusion is dissipating and the sense of the stillness for awareness as you're observing thoughts you invert your awareness in upon itself but it's still likely your awareness is still very likely to be conditioned by your thoughts your ideas your preconceptions your beliefs about consciousness because after all our experience is generally strongly conditioned by our past experience language acculturation personal history and so on but as you continue to release and relax while maintaining the clarity then you're you're not thinking back into but the locus of your awareness the word is Papa descends from it's an ordinary field which is all cut up in dualistic thinking and so forth radical deepened demarcation between subject and object it's slipping deeper and deeper into this dimension of consciousness</p>

<p>ah</p>
<p>welcome to the wisdom podcast my name is</p>
<p>daniel aiken and this week we are joined</p>
<p>by alan wallace</p>
<p>scholar and popular teacher of tibetan</p>
<p>buddhism alan is also one of the most</p>
<p>prolific writers and translators of</p>
<p>tibetan buddhism in the West this</p>
<p>episode is a little different in that it</p>
<p>was recorded in front of a live audience</p>
<p>that was the first time we've had a live</p>
<p>audience for the wisdom podcast which we</p>
<p>plan on doing a lot more in the future</p>
<p>so I hope you enjoy this episode with</p>
<p>Alan Watts</p>
<p>I wrote in my journal and the summers</p>
<p>late summers day in Bergen on the west</p>
<p>coast of Norway I need to meet a wise</p>
<p>old man and I need it quickly you know</p>
<p>basically and I'm not sure I kind of</p>
<p>believed or disbelieved as like kind of</p>
<p>amorphous about God and the divine</p>
<p>but just like hello University I need</p>
<p>universe not University</p>
<p>I need a wise old man and I was</p>
<p>hitchhiking on this long road from us</p>
<p>from Bergen to Oslo by myself and after</p>
<p>waiting about four or five hours by side</p>
<p>of the road a little black VW bug pulled</p>
<p>over to the side a little man waved to</p>
<p>me would like a ride and it turned out</p>
<p>he was a Buddhist monk and a fascinating</p>
<p>person he lived in Nepali live with</p>
<p>Tibetans and I learned all of this in</p>
<p>about ten minutes because he took me</p>
<p>about ten minutes down the road and then</p>
<p>dropped me off because he lived in a</p>
<p>chalet up in the mountain but he learned</p>
<p>I was introduced in Buddhism we</p>
<p>correspond 84 years after that but that</p>
<p>was that was kind of a wake-up call</p>
<p>because 1970 how many Buddhist monks</p>
<p>were there in Europe I think you</p>
<p>probably count them on one maximum two</p>
<p>hands and he came right when I called</p>
<p>and it kind of made me feel well there</p>
<p>are coincidence and then there are</p>
<p>coincidences and there's a point which</p>
<p>to say coincidence is just stupid and</p>
<p>this seemed to be one of the stupid</p>
<p>times just to say that yeah well it</p>
<p>happens yeah it did that was really a</p>
<p>coincidence but then when I followed you</p>
<p>know when I kept on I went down to</p>
<p>Gooding and find there was a vesting</p>
<p>Lama we just been appointed by the Dalai</p>
<p>Lama to be unfactored he with him went</p>
<p>after Switzerland trained there for a</p>
<p>few months for the summer and there my</p>
<p>safe but bought myself a one-way ticket</p>
<p>to India and immerse myself in the next</p>
<p>four years but what in short of the what</p>
<p>really pulled me was on the one had a</p>
<p>very deep intuitive sense of zopi in</p>
<p>which I didn't understand I just felt</p>
<p>this is it and it was 20 years before</p>
<p>circumstances came together for me to</p>
<p>really have an opportunity to immerse</p>
<p>myself in the study and practices Oh</p>
<p>Kenneth 1990 with garuda mochi until</p>
<p>then it was Olga Luba tera vaada Sakia</p>
<p>but it was but on a more cognitive level</p>
<p>I found here a tradition that was not</p>
<p>simply religion</p>
<p>simply science not simply philosophy it</p>
<p>includes all three elements but what</p>
<p>really caught me and then it's helped me</p>
<p>ever since is here is a path of ever</p>
<p>deepening meaning but also ever</p>
<p>deepening insight understanding</p>
<p>knowledge and they're all bound into one</p>
<p>wisdom and skillful means you could say</p>
<p>and that's been enormously can tell me</p>
<p>for me so you went to India basically in</p>
<p>search of meaning you had facts from the</p>
<p>science side of things so you're looking</p>
<p>for meaning but then you end up coming</p>
<p>back to the states and where do you go</p>
<p>you end up at em who are studying</p>
<p>physics is that right well back when I</p>
<p>was supposed to be there for an academic</p>
<p>year wound up dropping all my classes</p>
<p>that I was intending to do struck terror</p>
<p>in the hearts of my parents give me that</p>
<p>oh it's throwing away my entire future</p>
<p>which of course I did but I read</p>
<p>voraciously for that I basically became</p>
<p>a hermit for nine months and just read</p>
<p>voraciously and then wind up dropping</p>
<p>all my classes except for Tibetan</p>
<p>language because I figured this is my</p>
<p>path and in 1970 there were very few</p>
<p>people who are bilingual so if I was</p>
<p>serious about this and I was then I've</p>
<p>got to learn how to read and speak</p>
<p>Tibetan so that's all I did and then</p>
<p>read voraciously and you asked about</p>
<p>when I started reading I started</p>
<p>practicing meditation I started TM</p>
<p>Transcendental Meditation a year or two</p>
<p>earlier</p>
<p>and I was good but I wanted it more and</p>
<p>I picked up a marvelous book and it's</p>
<p>the heart of Buddhist meditation by</p>
<p>nanoparticle Tara outstanding German</p>
<p>scholar it was trained for years I met</p>
<p>him years later in 1980 it's an</p>
<p>outstanding it's still a classic and it</p>
<p>covers the mahasabha Pat Tomasulo an</p>
<p>excellent commentary to it I read that</p>
<p>and it just read on my own I had no</p>
<p>teacher but I thought I can practice</p>
<p>that this really makes sense and it was</p>
<p>not just meaning if somebody wanted</p>
<p>meaning I could have maybe tried to just</p>
<p>adopt some aberrant form of Christianity</p>
<p>and you know be a good heretical</p>
<p>Christian but I was looking for insight</p>
<p>for understanding for knowledge and here</p>
<p>the satipatthana sutra decided a ton of</p>
<p>practice before our closed applications</p>
<p>of mindfulness that's just that in</p>
<p>is that is it's tremendously meaningful</p>
<p>and yet it's so smart it's so sharp it's</p>
<p>intelligent it's radically empirical and</p>
<p>so I immerse myself and started</p>
<p>practicing that in 1970 on my own in</p>
<p>Germany and then bought myself a one-way</p>
<p>ticket to India and so then when you</p>
<p>came back and started at Amherst I'm</p>
<p>wondering what was the thought why why</p>
<p>after spending four years in Dharamsala</p>
<p>you know meeting all these llamas I</p>
<p>think I get you up tonight he's on insta</p>
<p>llama and then you come back and then</p>
<p>there's this pull back into academia and</p>
<p>I was wondering what would the</p>
<p>motivation behind that was sure well it</p>
<p>was more than four years I was in</p>
<p>Dharamsala from 71 to 75 had tremendous</p>
<p>and repeated health problems one after</p>
<p>another three cases of hepatitis I think</p>
<p>I got typhoid I had three types of worms</p>
<p>the list goes on and on it was</p>
<p>physically very very tough and mentally</p>
<p>and spiritually just a feast I mean it</p>
<p>was terrific but also really took a lot</p>
<p>of wear and tear on the body and then by</p>
<p>that time that by 1971 I had a personal</p>
<p>connection with His Holiness Dalai Lama</p>
<p>he was my husband is and will be my root</p>
<p>guru since 71 and so after been there</p>
<p>and I was I received my four-nation from</p>
<p>him since 1975 just a few months after</p>
<p>my ordination with him full ordination</p>
<p>then I met with him because my teacher</p>
<p>who gave me my novice ordination two</p>
<p>years earlier had been posted to become</p>
<p>abbot of the monastery the Recon</p>
<p>monastery and journey in Switzerland and</p>
<p>again my second home so I met with him</p>
<p>and and just simply simply asked him</p>
<p>where can I be of greatest benefit shall</p>
<p>I stay here in Dharamsala continue</p>
<p>meditating and so on</p>
<p>I toured also spent more than a year in</p>
<p>the Buddhist school dialectics so it had</p>
<p>fairly rigorous training there so I</p>
<p>should shall I stay here in Dharamsala</p>
<p>or shall I accompany my teacher back to</p>
<p>Switzerland by then I was fluent in</p>
<p>Tibetan my kid services interpreter</p>
<p>continued my own training and to</p>
<p>whatever is helpful and he said go west</p>
<p>young man</p>
<p>and so in 1975 then I went back to</p>
<p>Switzerland spent four and a half years</p>
<p>there a translating for him eventually I</p>
<p>was teaching I was translating writing</p>
<p>practicing</p>
<p>after about nine or ten years by the</p>
<p>time I got to the end of the 70s it</p>
<p>would been had been pretty intensive</p>
<p>training lots and lots of teaching</p>
<p>including a good dose of tera vaada</p>
<p>which I received from one monk who came</p>
<p>to dance alone I study with him</p>
<p>intensely for a summer maybe a bit more</p>
<p>but then after night by the United end</p>
<p>of 1979 I just felt kind of saturated</p>
<p>with undigested knowledge but not that</p>
<p>I'd understood but not assimilated so I</p>
<p>wrote to his holiness and said all I</p>
<p>want to do now is meditate for a while</p>
<p>and where shall I go shall I go back to</p>
<p>America stay in Switzerland to come back</p>
<p>to India and he said come to Mindy I'll</p>
<p>teach you I'll teach you meditation I</p>
<p>didn't take long to decide what to do</p>
<p>and so I spent the next four years from</p>
<p>beginning of 1984 through three end of</p>
<p>1983 basically just in a series of</p>
<p>meditative retreats in India Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Insight Meditation Society right here in</p>
<p>Boston you are outside of Boston Manor</p>
<p>and living in the breakers out in</p>
<p>Arizona and so on for years than just</p>
<p>just meditating and by that time I had</p>
<p>really been out of the mainstream of</p>
<p>Western civilization for thirteen years</p>
<p>and I would often say not really ingest</p>
<p>but I was born at the age of 20 I just</p>
<p>flew in like with my pals in Hindi or</p>
<p>Switzerland so forth I would say I was</p>
<p>born at the age of 20 because that's the</p>
<p>the age at which things started making</p>
<p>sense and before that first 20 years was</p>
<p>a drumroll to actually having in a</p>
<p>beginning when I thought was a</p>
<p>meaningful life but by the time I was</p>
<p>2033 almost 34 then I just thought I</p>
<p>went to Asia and I immersed myself in</p>
<p>Tibetan culture and primarily in</p>
<p>buddhadharma to seek integration to live</p>
<p>a whole and meaningful and truthful life</p>
<p>integrating meaning and wisdom insight</p>
<p>knowledge and what I done in the process</p>
<p>is completely bifurcate myself into the</p>
<p>first twenty years in the last 14 and</p>
<p>had alienated myself from my own culture</p>
<p>so I felt a stranger in my own home and</p>
<p>completely doesn't continue my Western</p>
<p>education and I thought well maybe now</p>
<p>after 14 years of quite thorough</p>
<p>immersion in a very different culture</p>
<p>and whole spiritual tradition</p>
<p>maybe it's time to integrate to begin</p>
<p>integrating and so I was accepted at</p>
<p>Amherst College to wish I was there an</p>
<p>enormous privilege it's an outstanding</p>
<p>college and that was in 84 and decided</p>
<p>to study physics because I've have</p>
<p>thought here here's the paradigm here's</p>
<p>the here's the the template for Western</p>
<p>Sciences the whole Galileo started it</p>
<p>and all the other branches of science</p>
<p>suffer from physics Envy I've been told</p>
<p>you know emulating this tremendous</p>
<p>success story of physics going back to</p>
<p>Copernicus Kepler Galileo Newton and on</p>
<p>there is science at its most dazzling</p>
<p>one can say from my perspective and so</p>
<p>why not study that you know and then and</p>
<p>do all the hard work does that do the</p>
<p>mathematics do from classical mechanics</p>
<p>and electromagnetism all the way through</p>
<p>but what I was really curious about was</p>
<p>quantum mechanics and so I thought if</p>
<p>there's going to be some real meaningful</p>
<p>engagement between modern physics and</p>
<p>the Buddhist tradition which I get I've</p>
<p>been trained by them for 14 years I</p>
<p>thought it's gonna be here quantum</p>
<p>mechanics because this is now</p>
<p>challenging a lot of the absolutes that</p>
<p>pervaded classical physics absolute</p>
<p>space time matter energy so I won't</p>
<p>elaborate in quantum mechanics but I was</p>
<p>very intrigued and so that's what I did</p>
<p>Adam Martin a marvelous mentor one was</p>
<p>named I'm glad to mention Arthur Zions</p>
<p>he remains one of my dearest friends and</p>
<p>he really took me under his wing he</p>
<p>guided me through my training and</p>
<p>history of physics philosophy of science</p>
<p>quantum mechanics and with Bob Thurman</p>
<p>I studied Sanskrit and I wrote a 500</p>
<p>page thesis and left a very happy camper</p>
<p>how old are you at this stage 36 when I</p>
<p>graduate Wow so you fit so much in</p>
<p>already and and at that time you were</p>
<p>studying you were still I think you were</p>
<p>still you know getting teachings I think</p>
<p>you've met up with Ganley marimba and</p>
<p>you were also going out to the</p>
<p>California desert and doing retreats and</p>
<p>all this all these kind of things and so</p>
<p>I'm wondering I was wondering</p>
<p>particularly about Ganley marimba and</p>
<p>he's rumored to have a Qi</p>
<p>chanita and I was wondering if where</p>
<p>your interest in geometry practice came</p>
<p>from and whether he was an influence on</p>
<p>you in that regard</p>
<p>yeah so during my years two-and-a-half</p>
<p>years yet Amherst</p>
<p>they gave me two semesters and I was</p>
<p>writing a very big thesis why asking for</p>
<p>one more semester because I was full</p>
<p>scholarship I came out without that</p>
<p>without debt which is enormous</p>
<p>I have enormous gratitude for Emmer's</p>
<p>for that so I spent five semesters there</p>
<p>and during that time I was still</p>
<p>ordained I was a monk so as a Buddhist</p>
<p>monk studying physics mathematics</p>
<p>history of science philosophy of science</p>
<p>but an incognito monk and then when I</p>
<p>graduated all I wanted to do is go off</p>
<p>into retreating him so I went slipped</p>
<p>off to the Eastern Sierra the high</p>
<p>desert of the Eastern Sierra Nevada</p>
<p>mountains in California and was there</p>
<p>for about a year and in the meantime</p>
<p>back in 1980 when I when a solon is</p>
<p>invited me back to India to meditate I</p>
<p>was given by a truly marvelous Tibetan</p>
<p>yogi by the name again Shama wanted old</p>
<p>friends with lama zopa rinpoche and I</p>
<p>remember so forth again Shama Wondrich</p>
<p>was a yogi yogi and he moved into gates</p>
<p>or uplands empty cabin left his cabin</p>
<p>vacant so he invited me to do my retreat</p>
<p>in his cabin and so at that time one of</p>
<p>the Yogi's Tibetan Yogi's living at</p>
<p>there about an hour and a half hike</p>
<p>above McLeod Ganj about Dharamsala one</p>
<p>of the Yogi's living up there was gama</p>
<p>marimba and he allowed me to come and</p>
<p>drop in on him once a week just for me</p>
<p>to consult with him about my practice</p>
<p>his holiness with guiding my practice</p>
<p>but he had a few other things to do with</p>
<p>his time besides guide me so I couldn't</p>
<p>just drop in on him whenever I wanted to</p>
<p>is given I'm River was more available so</p>
<p>I would see his holiness whenever I</p>
<p>could began my remember I got to know</p>
<p>quite well and developed a real</p>
<p>friendship with him at a very deep sense</p>
<p>of reverence and respect it's just a</p>
<p>tremendous you'll be a wonderful monk</p>
<p>scholar and contemplative so we got to</p>
<p>know each other that way and then after</p>
<p>I'd finished up at Amherst and that was</p>
<p>in 86 then with a bit of preparation and</p>
<p>I asked His Holiness</p>
<p>whether he would allow Gemma if young</p>
<p>member of wish to come whether he be</p>
<p>willing to come and lead a one-year</p>
<p>shamah to retreat a group retreat</p>
<p>because I've been teaching in Seattle</p>
<p>for some time at that point and aroused</p>
<p>a certain amount of interest in this and</p>
<p>he consulted with His Holiness his own</p>
<p>and has told him yes it would be good</p>
<p>idea to come so he came for all of 1970</p>
<p>1988 1988 he led and I was kind of his</p>
<p>apprentice a one-year shamah to retreat</p>
<p>for 12 people and it went very very well</p>
<p>everybody in the retreat said it was the</p>
<p>most meaningful year of their lives but</p>
<p>in terms of mine in the first teacher</p>
<p>the first Lama from whom I received</p>
<p>sustained and very rigorous training was</p>
<p>cashing home anti-gay because I went to</p>
<p>Dharma Zala expressly because under the</p>
<p>auspices of His Holiness Dalai Lama the</p>
<p>Tibetan works the Tibetan light come</p>
<p>library of Tibetan worked in archives</p>
<p>had just opened the doors and they were</p>
<p>they held a one-year course in Buddhism</p>
<p>and so I went from Switzerland to to</p>
<p>Dharamsala because of that course I was</p>
<p>studying with a sakya lama in</p>
<p>Switzerland and I wanted to go to Nepal</p>
<p>and find a cave with some yogi in it</p>
<p>they take one look at me and say my</p>
<p>chela my chela you know leading me to</p>
<p>enlightenment</p>
<p>but this bulletin came from Dharamsala</p>
<p>and my sakya lama in switzerland said go</p>
<p>there so I just made a beeline there but</p>
<p>caching anti-gay when he was teaching he</p>
<p>taught all of lamrim I taught the guide</p>
<p>to the Bodhisattva way of life he also</p>
<p>taught the abyss AMA alankara or the</p>
<p>ornament for the Ottoman for clear</p>
<p>realization and in all of these</p>
<p>teachings including shantideva shaman is</p>
<p>there I mean it's very explicitly there</p>
<p>and I remember very vividly I don't want</p>
<p>to go on too long here I remember very</p>
<p>vividly when again when getting on Tiger</p>
<p>we're teaching Islam remain you got to</p>
<p>the schemata just before the passion of</p>
<p>course he said well why don't we</p>
<p>practice a little bit</p>
<p>he'd be teaching as you know the by the</p>
<p>book and then he said well let's</p>
<p>practice of it so there's just eight of</p>
<p>us and this one year of course and so</p>
<p>he's so I'm up for it you know so we sat</p>
<p>there and he sat like there's like a</p>
<p>stone Buddha and after 20 minutes I and</p>
<p>I think the others in our class were</p>
<p>getting getting fidgety and</p>
<p>uncomfortable and half an hour goes by</p>
<p>getting more uncomfortable an hour wind</p>
<p>by he's not moving a muscle and then</p>
<p>we're in physic</p>
<p>agony and two hours goes by and three</p>
<p>hours go by by that time we're basically</p>
<p>internally scream our heads off were so</p>
<p>much pain and then in a gift moment I</p>
<p>get gently opened his eyes look at us</p>
<p>and said Shawn that is not so easy so</p>
<p>but he said many things that really</p>
<p>captured my attention he said you know</p>
<p>if you've achieved summer to them the</p>
<p>passion is easy and when he was teaching</p>
<p>us the abysm alankara this definitive</p>
<p>presentation of the five paths starting</p>
<p>with the path of accumulation</p>
<p>culminating associate rock our Heartland</p>
<p>by the Sante path as a buddha according</p>
<p>to the lineage in which he was trained</p>
<p>which I received if you want to reach</p>
<p>just the first path well the the crucial</p>
<p>element is you so deeply cultivate</p>
<p>bodhichitta that arises spontaneously</p>
<p>effortlessly but for that to happen your</p>
<p>mind has to be wonderfully stable fit</p>
<p>free of the by Box curations and for</p>
<p>that you have to achieve schemata</p>
<p>achieve shaman not just work at it but</p>
<p>you should have achieved schemata which</p>
<p>indicates a very very exceptional degree</p>
<p>of mental health and balance and with</p>
<p>that basis you cultivate bodhichitta to</p>
<p>the point that there rises spontaneously</p>
<p>and then you reach the path and so I</p>
<p>listen to that mr. boat that's the most</p>
<p>important thing to do and it was</p>
<p>actually oddly enough it was a reason</p>
<p>for me leaving after about a year and a</p>
<p>half my formal monastic training was on</p>
<p>the track to becoming a Geisha because</p>
<p>I'd receive all the basic training and</p>
<p>logic and debate and Buddhist psychology</p>
<p>and and so forth and we are just about</p>
<p>to begin</p>
<p>six years of training six years</p>
<p>continuously of the other semi alankara</p>
<p>which we'd exhaustively in detail study</p>
<p>the five Madiga as if I've passed the</p>
<p>1000 Bodhisattva Bloomie's but there</p>
<p>came a little interference on this</p>
<p>trajectory and that is who inca the wink</p>
<p>at the burmese meditation master he was</p>
<p>invited to Dharamsala to lead his 10-day</p>
<p>retreat and his holiness told all of us</p>
<p>in a monastery we should all go and so</p>
<p>well then you go your route Lama I just</p>
<p>said go so it and so there I was in</p>
<p>going cos we treat starting it like for</p>
<p>in the morning meditating 11 hours a day</p>
<p>and in in these 10 days I looked at my</p>
<p>mind and it was like an enormous garbage</p>
<p>dump that was alive with living garbage</p>
<p>you know just so much noise and</p>
<p>agitation and imbalances and so forth</p>
<p>and I looked at this and after about</p>
<p>eight or nine days of this I said what</p>
<p>would I be doing studying the five paths</p>
<p>and the ten are you put us after boonies</p>
<p>when I can't even see the bottom edge of</p>
<p>the lowest path because I'm Way down</p>
<p>here and so why don't I just drew</p>
<p>everything I possibly can to try to</p>
<p>reach the first path but this means I</p>
<p>don't need detailed knowledge of the</p>
<p>five paths and the ten boomys I just</p>
<p>need to learn how to become a bit saner</p>
<p>so with His Holiness permission I</p>
<p>dropped out and once again I drop out</p>
<p>dropped out of Western a key to me and I</p>
<p>dropped out of eastern academia and just</p>
<p>often meditated it's all I wanted to do</p>
<p>and then so that was so that led to four</p>
<p>years of retreat from 80 to 84 and then</p>
<p>gallim Rimba came in 1988 and then he</p>
<p>caught the Shama to a retreat and it</p>
<p>just struck me ever since that this is</p>
<p>something that is universally important</p>
<p>in Buddhism Theravada but and perfectly</p>
<p>clear and in any school of Buddhist you</p>
<p>have Sheila Samadhi flat yeah you can't</p>
<p>skip Samadhi</p>
<p>don't blow it off a momentary samadhi</p>
<p>that's a gimmick Samadhi is more among</p>
<p>more than just a little momentary</p>
<p>business it's something quite serious</p>
<p>and in the - in the my Anna and the vaad</p>
<p>Rihanna everywhere Sean that is</p>
<p>everywhere cropping up and yet to my</p>
<p>astonishment as the years went by is</p>
<p>seen that it was either overlooked</p>
<p>marginalized or tore trivialized and so</p>
<p>it just struck me this is a missing</p>
<p>piece so many things are talking well</p>
<p>really well in the Terracotta tradition</p>
<p>the charm is in all schools in Tibetan</p>
<p>Buddhism many outstanding teachers and</p>
<p>many outstanding teachings and and of</p>
<p>course a number of people teach</p>
<p>summative but not that many really</p>
<p>emphasize it and so I can be taking that</p>
<p>to heart</p>
<p>so after hearing that I can't help but</p>
<p>ask a technical question well you're</p>
<p>talking about geometry and bodhichitta</p>
<p>and I'm wondering if you think that you</p>
<p>have to it's necessary to achieve Shama</p>
<p>table before you can achieve bodhichitta</p>
<p>yeah the whole notion of achieving</p>
<p>bodhichitta by you as a scholar you know</p>
<p>this is referring to in the benjamin my</p>
<p>and hngg sam uncontrived effortless</p>
<p>spontaneously arising bodhichitta such</p>
<p>you've cultivated so deeply that it's</p>
<p>your more your default mode your ground</p>
<p>state and it could be actively triggered</p>
<p>by virtually anything and then just</p>
<p>Bowditch it is there you know it's a</p>
<p>primary mind it's not just an aspiration</p>
<p>have once in a while it's like your</p>
<p>prime directive and when that sinks so</p>
<p>deeply into your psyche almost into your</p>
<p>marrow</p>
<p>that it's just your your desire of</p>
<p>desires for which all other desires are</p>
<p>derivative that's when you've achieved</p>
<p>bodhichitta and then at that point</p>
<p>you're a Buddhist actor so is it</p>
<p>necessary to have fully achieved siya</p>
<p>matter and by that I mean technically</p>
<p>then access to the first jhana because</p>
<p>that's that's how the term is used in in</p>
<p>the whole intro Tibetan tradition there</p>
<p>is scholarly debate on this point in the</p>
<p>tradition of getting on Tiger Lama Zopa</p>
<p>Rinpoche issue wrapped in the set at the</p>
<p>ceviche tradition they say yeah you need</p>
<p>to fully achieve da Matta in order to</p>
<p>bring about that depth and that degree</p>
<p>of spontaneity bodhichitta but other</p>
<p>very well very erudite scholars say not</p>
<p>entire you don't need to achieve all</p>
<p>nine stages you certainly must have a</p>
<p>stable mind certainly the five</p>
<p>obscurations must be attenuated their</p>
<p>beings kind of craving central craving</p>
<p>laxity and excitation like laxity and</p>
<p>dullness excitation and anxiety and</p>
<p>afflictive afflictive uncertainty I</p>
<p>think I just and they'll will enmity so</p>
<p>those five have to be really in abeyance</p>
<p>it's hard to imagine a mind that is very</p>
<p>prone to ill-will and animosity in that</p>
<p>same mind stream but it's just arising</p>
<p>that's kind of like that's not gonna</p>
<p>happen</p>
<p>so there's scholarly debate whether you</p>
<p>need simply a very good degree of</p>
<p>Samadhi I mean really good like I'm nine</p>
<p>stages leading to schemata okay Stage</p>
<p>five given I'm Reba said he told me with</p>
<p>doing that one year that I lived with</p>
<p>him in 1988 during this one year retreat</p>
<p>he said it was not uncommon in the</p>
<p>gloopy tradition for very serious Yogi's</p>
<p>like himself in terms of schemata just</p>
<p>to go up to the fifth</p>
<p>out of nine stages sending Appa the</p>
<p>fifth of nine stages at that point your</p>
<p>course excitation is is through you can</p>
<p>sit for an hour maybe longer with an</p>
<p>unbroken flow of mindfulness never</p>
<p>completely disengaging for a meditative</p>
<p>object the mind has reason to be clear</p>
<p>you're somebody's pretty darn good and</p>
<p>he said it was common in his tradition</p>
<p>the glue per tradition to achieve that</p>
<p>as a flat Shama to practice focusing on</p>
<p>an image of buddha shakyamuni or</p>
<p>whatever method you like and then with</p>
<p>that degree of samadhi then go right</p>
<p>into state regeneration practice and</p>
<p>then finish off what you started with in</p>
<p>the context of stage of generation</p>
<p>practice but in as a point of fact and</p>
<p>some couple points this out jujube Ling</p>
<p>pointed out the great name a llama llama</p>
<p>meet Pomona birch a point out they've</p>
<p>all said from the fifteenth century</p>
<p>until the present relatively few people</p>
<p>actually fully achieve summit most of</p>
<p>them seem to be in a hurry well achieve</p>
<p>a little bit and then Rob the state</p>
<p>regeneration or just do a lamb rim or 13</p>
<p>do more they're doing so to Norma mudra</p>
<p>they're eager to get to the good stuff</p>
<p>and summit is like thinking about summit</p>
<p>Hindus do summit how important could</p>
<p>that be you know that of sectarian bias</p>
<p>comes in or the Indiana they do schemata</p>
<p>how come born exactly you know but</p>
<p>that's a sectarian talk it is enormous</p>
<p>Lee important and there's there's a</p>
<p>story from Buddha's own life after he</p>
<p>had finished his six years of aesthetic</p>
<p>practices damaged his health restored</p>
<p>his health and in might recall from the</p>
<p>nakaya's then then the Buddha was the</p>
<p>gautuma the age of 35 was wondering what</p>
<p>now because he had already tried Samadhi</p>
<p>tried all these ascetic practices and so</p>
<p>forth and then he recalled a time as a</p>
<p>youth maybe is 12 13 years old something</p>
<p>like that where he was simply sitting</p>
<p>quietly under a rose apple tree while</p>
<p>his father was out doing some ritual and</p>
<p>a royal ritual and he spontaneously</p>
<p>slipped into the first Jana just slip</p>
<p>right into it since it was drew the 5ox</p>
<p>creation went down the mine whose supple</p>
<p>it was filled with well-being was his</p>
<p>sense of what bliss and so forth and</p>
<p>most importantly release fit for action</p>
<p>you know supple</p>
<p>ha that scent that Sanskrit term</p>
<p>supplements malleability and then as</p>
<p>it's that cropped up spontaneously then</p>
<p>when the Risha was over he had to get on</p>
<p>with his life then it also subsided he</p>
<p>got it that it was just a taste and but</p>
<p>he recalled the age of 35 he recalled</p>
<p>that that first jhana and it and then</p>
<p>the thought arose in his mind he said</p>
<p>the thought arose in my mind might that</p>
<p>be the way to enlightenment and then</p>
<p>answer came back yes so then in a</p>
<p>relatively short time he reassures jhana</p>
<p>and then on that basis its history</p>
<p>achieved perfect enlightenment but he</p>
<p>himself indicated in that statement the</p>
<p>first jhana it's all it's very good to</p>
<p>achieve more but that one I think</p>
<p>there's pretty I think among really</p>
<p>knowledgeable scholars like Kim in</p>
<p>doTERRA now standing tera vaada scholar</p>
<p>and very widely accepted in the Indo</p>
<p>Tibetan tradition that degree this</p>
<p>access to the first jhana or the full</p>
<p>first jhana these are indispensable to</p>
<p>really proceed along the path to become</p>
<p>a sonnet on this Roddick Ayana to become</p>
<p>a stream enter and so forth and on the</p>
<p>my on a path to become a bodhisattva and</p>
<p>proceed on the Bodhisattva path this is</p>
<p>this is the kind of the the gold</p>
<p>standard of what I would call mental</p>
<p>health and balance and you need an</p>
<p>exceptional degree because if a person</p>
<p>is not just about of course stress</p>
<p>reduction or gaining an insight here or</p>
<p>there but Vibhishana in union with a</p>
<p>passion with sha meta which is the</p>
<p>Buddhist great innovation that had never</p>
<p>been taught I think in the tradition of</p>
<p>the Indian contemplative heritage</p>
<p>prior to the Buddha was a great</p>
<p>innovation it is that combination of</p>
<p>schemata and the passion that has the</p>
<p>power to completely eradicate mental</p>
<p>afflictions from the root so that really</p>
<p>caught my attention early on and I just</p>
<p>felt you can't skip sha meta or you can</p>
<p>but then none of your other practices</p>
<p>will come to full fruition I like to</p>
<p>fast forward a little bit to you meeting</p>
<p>Giotto Rinpoche and coming into contact</p>
<p>with those oak chain teachings again</p>
<p>because you know back if there Evans</p>
<p>whence this book you you it started your</p>
<p>path yeah</p>
<p>and I was wondering if you could speak a</p>
<p>little bit with you know your earlier</p>
<p>training was always Galaga in tsongkhapa</p>
<p>and I was wondering how you integrated</p>
<p>your earlier training in the global</p>
<p>image with the Zoltan teachings if you</p>
<p>could just speak a little bit to that</p>
<p>sure I'll try to be concise which all my</p>
<p>students learn terrible yeah I was my</p>
<p>initial inspiration to follow the path</p>
<p>of Tibetan Buddhism or into Tibetan</p>
<p>Buddhism was this book on zouk Chen but</p>
<p>then circumstances simply unfolded in</p>
<p>such a way that I had really no access</p>
<p>to zou Chen teachings for 20 years it</p>
<p>was there and I was immensely nourished</p>
<p>both in terms of growth of understanding</p>
<p>and knowledge and also an</p>
<p>ever-increasing sense of meaning through</p>
<p>those 20 years I I wouldn't give away</p>
<p>one year of it it was 20 years very well</p>
<p>spent and and by the time I was 90 next</p>
<p>I was 90 19 1990 don't tell how early by</p>
<p>the time of 1990s always 40 years old</p>
<p>I think Plato said that's when you when</p>
<p>you're allowed to start start studying</p>
<p>philosophy at the age of 40 I think he</p>
<p>said so I had 40 years under my belt and</p>
<p>one of my oldest and dearest Dharma</p>
<p>friends is a woman named Sangha Kondo</p>
<p>it's a very accomplished translator</p>
<p>teacher really an outstanding person and</p>
<p>would be with we've been buddies since</p>
<p>1972 or so way back and so we kept in</p>
<p>touch just in a very nice friendship and</p>
<p>she early on the years and years before</p>
<p>1990 she become very close disciple and</p>
<p>an interpreter for gateau de mogi so I</p>
<p>would drop in on her once in a while and</p>
<p>I meet her Lama we would get to know him</p>
<p>a little bit checking him out you know</p>
<p>and then in 1990 by that time I had</p>
<p>spent a couple of years in retreat out</p>
<p>of academia and decided to continue my</p>
<p>education so when I matriculated at</p>
<p>Stanford in the in the ph.d program in</p>
<p>religious studies and so I was living</p>
<p>there in the Bay Area but really knowing</p>
<p>that if I stayed only in academia it</p>
<p>would be quite arid from my perspective</p>
<p>lots of fact and not a whole lot of</p>
<p>meaning in the methodology you know</p>
<p>because it's just radically not Orion</p>
<p>it's practice keep the objective stance</p>
<p>which means stand outside up and don't</p>
<p>go native whereas I was obviously I was</p>
<p>already a lost cause I was native</p>
<p>already and so yeah Jenna but you're</p>
<p>very happily decided to move down from</p>
<p>Oregon for a while to the Bay Area and</p>
<p>so he gave some teachings on dream yoga</p>
<p>in 1999 gioconda was translating he gave</p>
<p>it in San Jose and I'd received</p>
<p>teachings on dream yoga from the sole</p>
<p>member jayx a great very great galloper</p>
<p>Lama back in 1978 in Switzerland I</p>
<p>served as his interpreter for all the</p>
<p>six yoga's of Naropa so I had some</p>
<p>acquaintances but Keyshia Dobson who</p>
<p>organized this invited him to give us</p>
<p>his teachings he totally just flat out I</p>
<p>want you to receive these teachings now</p>
<p>but it's over your head you know just</p>
<p>get the imprints now but don't think</p>
<p>about practice you're not ready yet so</p>
<p>that was now 12 years later guttered</p>
<p>which is teaching dream younger but he's</p>
<p>teaching it like you can really practice</p>
<p>this you're teaching it experientially</p>
<p>and in this kind of this men mapped mode</p>
<p>this mode of pith instructions there's</p>
<p>nothing academic about it and I just</p>
<p>drank it in like nectar and so it was</p>
<p>just a very strong connection I said</p>
<p>okay this this is a person I'd love to</p>
<p>read you know how does one of my long</p>
<p>lines and so as it turns out just a</p>
<p>marvelous opportunity arose up for me</p>
<p>for the next seven years from 1990</p>
<p>through 97 I want to being his his</p>
<p>primary interpreter he's living in the</p>
<p>Bay Area Sangre Honda was up in Oregon</p>
<p>so various circumstances came together</p>
<p>so I had the just priceless opportunity</p>
<p>to serve as his interpreter for the last</p>
<p>two years I was living with him</p>
<p>just a little cottage across from his</p>
<p>and so he gave those teachings on you</p>
<p>canto translating and then not too long</p>
<p>after that he had been invited down to</p>
<p>the Shambhala Center in Hollywood and he</p>
<p>said Alan I'd like you to come down and</p>
<p>translate for me I said sure glad to</p>
<p>honored so he came down to the Shambhala</p>
<p>center and he was 1990-1991 motel ago</p>
<p>and he picked out two chapters from a</p>
<p>great text on the Union of Muhammad</p>
<p>Renzo Chen by Camacho net which hasn't</p>
<p>been translated it's certainly called</p>
<p>the Delta TM the great commentary and he</p>
<p>picked out two chapters within the</p>
<p>Mohammed results in tradition schemata</p>
<p>and her passion</p>
<p>and that's how he started me off so I</p>
<p>was getting shamaton you know all the</p>
<p>way through remember every teacher</p>
<p>really and it was just breathtaking and</p>
<p>seeing well here was this smooth segue</p>
<p>because guess you're traveling back in</p>
<p>1976 had taught us and I was</p>
<p>interpreting for him pensioner punches</p>
<p>text his route text and commentary on my</p>
<p>mudra so and it just enchanted me I</p>
<p>really drew me so during my four years</p>
<p>of solitary practice I went a lot in</p>
<p>that direction and now yeah Tran watch</p>
<p>is teaching it from the union of the</p>
<p>kagu and yingwan traditions whereas I</p>
<p>had it from the Union of the guide you</p>
<p>and galloper tradition so it's this</p>
<p>seamless transition and so he taught</p>
<p>those and it was just like I was just</p>
<p>thrilled I mean literally I was thrilled</p>
<p>and so he continues staying on there in</p>
<p>the Bay Area and then he just taught one</p>
<p>text after another and every single one</p>
<p>of them a spacious path to freedom</p>
<p>make it awareness natural liberation</p>
<p>badness mother's teaching of the six</p>
<p>bardos he taught a short text by Zhu</p>
<p>Jian member jenshaw Madiba pacchiana he</p>
<p>taught the Vajra essence every single</p>
<p>text that he taught while during those</p>
<p>seven years that I was translating for</p>
<p>him every single one emphasized the</p>
<p>enormous importance of Muruga of path</p>
<p>we're here to not just practice Dharma</p>
<p>but to reach the path and move along the</p>
<p>path the fourth noble truth after all</p>
<p>and every single one of them emphasized</p>
<p>shammed so I had this from every side</p>
<p>and so he has just been my like my</p>
<p>spiritual father and my primary so chin</p>
<p>Oh chin Lama and the teachings that he's</p>
<p>passed on to me and authorized me to</p>
<p>pass on to others is just it's a Philip</p>
<p>fulfillment of my heart's desire but</p>
<p>happily my root Lama of course is his</p>
<p>old mentor Dalai Lama and of all the</p>
<p>galoop Obama's that he is largely a</p>
<p>kalapa Lama he more than any other I</p>
<p>know with no comparison completely</p>
<p>integrates the teachings ons auction</p>
<p>which you receive from Tengu cancer</p>
<p>temperature and other great Enuma Lamas</p>
<p>and his whole his whole formidable good</p>
<p>look the background and I received on</p>
<p>multiple occasions ochen teachings from</p>
<p>him and so he made it very easy for me</p>
<p>here's you know the Lama of Lamas as far</p>
<p>as I'm concerned and seamlessly</p>
<p>integrating these and that's what I've</p>
<p>that's what I've sought to do for the</p>
<p>last 26 years so it's been in no way an</p>
<p>abandonment of my back</p>
<p>tera vaada Ella for six months in sri</p>
<p>lanka studied with inanimate raya</p>
<p>formidable Sri Lankan teacher monk</p>
<p>scholar he took me under his wing and</p>
<p>trained me so it's in no way a</p>
<p>disengagement for my tera vaada</p>
<p>background legal oopah but rather it's</p>
<p>the one translation of Zhou Chen is the</p>
<p>great incumbent the great completion the</p>
<p>great perfection are particularly good</p>
<p>but there's ocean makes sense of all of</p>
<p>the different paths and from my mind not</p>
<p>only within Buddhism but actually it</p>
<p>enables me to make sense of spiritual</p>
<p>traditions outside of Buddhism and for</p>
<p>that matter corner cosmology and certain</p>
<p>elements of love science and philosophy</p>
<p>of mind thank you so much my pleasure so</p>
<p>I think we're gonna have about a five</p>
<p>minute break and then Alan is going to</p>
<p>come back and give us a short Dharma</p>
<p>talk thank you well I'd like to go</p>
<p>during these 20 minutes is to a very</p>
<p>rich and concise excerpt from the Vajra</p>
<p>essence which is a third of the three</p>
<p>volumes here of Dijon lingas collected</p>
<p>works arms of chen in which Padma Sam</p>
<p>bhava by way of do gem Linga draws to my</p>
<p>mind a marvelously clear distinction</p>
<p>between what we call mind or chitta</p>
<p>in Sanskrit and rickman were pristine</p>
<p>awareness what's the difference between</p>
<p>the two and I think he lays this out in</p>
<p>a definitive extremely clear fashion but</p>
<p>I'd like to build up to a little bit</p>
<p>leave that for the grand finale and go</p>
<p>back to excerpts from the text that for</p>
<p>those of you who have followed the</p>
<p>course on the foolish Dharma of an idiot</p>
<p>clothed in madmen feathers one of the</p>
<p>most concise of Digium lingas</p>
<p>masterpieces really unsoaked chen just</p>
<p>take a brief excerpt from that because</p>
<p>he's talking about how you set out on</p>
<p>the path of so chen</p>
<p>what's the entry and i quote from a pure</p>
<p>vision a visionary teaching that he</p>
<p>received in which he's told in in a</p>
<p>dream hey hey hue blind one who wished</p>
<p>to enter the authentic path listen</p>
<p>by authentic path that means a path that</p>
<p>actually brings about irreversible</p>
<p>purification transformation so you never</p>
<p>fall back if it's not that it's not a</p>
<p>path it's practicing Dharma it's being</p>
<p>virtuous perhaps but a path means you're</p>
<p>actually evolving irreversibly on the</p>
<p>path of ever growing freedom and</p>
<p>awakening and so those who wish to enter</p>
<p>the authentic path listen the body is</p>
<p>like a paper bag blown by the wind</p>
<p>speech is like the sound of air passing</p>
<p>through a pipe this mind is a creator of</p>
<p>both samsara and Nirvana among these</p>
<p>three identify which is primary you have</p>
<p>a long time to wait before you'll see or</p>
<p>hear something called meditation and so</p>
<p>he's starting out with this emphasis</p>
<p>this encouragement for us individually</p>
<p>to investigate not just think about or</p>
<p>rely upon other people Authority and so</p>
<p>forth or simple logic but investigate</p>
<p>experientially within our own continuum</p>
<p>of being embodied human beings with</p>
<p>minds and bodies and speech among these</p>
<p>three ways of manifesting in the world</p>
<p>body speech and mind often called the</p>
<p>three doors which is primary and he</p>
<p>really emphasizes in more than one I</p>
<p>think perhaps all of his five major</p>
<p>treatises on so Chen this is the first</p>
<p>thing you've got to get right because if</p>
<p>you're wobbly amorphous or you just</p>
<p>flat-out wrong you'll not be able to</p>
<p>enter this path because you're starting</p>
<p>out with a fundamental fault hypothesis</p>
<p>and everything will go screwy from that</p>
<p>perspective and so of course in the Seok</p>
<p>Jin view it is the mind that is primary</p>
<p>speech is derivative and even body is</p>
<p>derivative now this is an absolutely</p>
<p>core theme it's not simply a required</p>
<p>belief it's a truth that must be known</p>
<p>where you decide on in this path if you</p>
<p>sing something contrary that's fine you</p>
<p>don't get punished for it but</p>
<p>this path is not open to you and so this</p>
<p>has though precedence all the way down</p>
<p>to the most foundational teachings in</p>
<p>the whole Buddhist tradition in the Pali</p>
<p>Canon for example in the Samia ticket</p>
<p>nakiya the Buddha states and I quote the</p>
<p>world is led by the mind just generally</p>
<p>in the universe mind is primary ok or</p>
<p>the ever so often quoted first verse of</p>
<p>the first chapter of the Dhammapada all</p>
<p>phenomena are preceded by the mind issue</p>
<p>forth from the mind and consist of the</p>
<p>mind clearly that has multiple</p>
<p>interpretations I don't mean to be</p>
<p>always simplistic here but he said what</p>
<p>he said and then we go to the Mahayana</p>
<p>tradition to the one of the minor sutras</p>
<p>that rathne mega sutra and here the</p>
<p>buddha in the sutra states all phenomena</p>
<p>are preceded by the mind when the mind</p>
<p>is comprehended all phenomena are</p>
<p>comprehended by bringing the mind under</p>
<p>control all things are brought under</p>
<p>control so this is a recurrent theme</p>
<p>through all schools of Buddhism that the</p>
<p>mind is primary when we address the</p>
<p>first noble truth yes there's physical</p>
<p>pain never to be marginalised but after</p>
<p>all the deeper forms of suffering are</p>
<p>not physical they're mental the</p>
<p>suffering of change the suffering that</p>
<p>goes with just the grasping to I am its</p>
<p>mental suffering when you look at the</p>
<p>second noble truth it's mental it's not</p>
<p>brain it's not genetics if not</p>
<p>environment it's not politics it's the</p>
<p>mind it's your mental afflictions that</p>
<p>are at the root of all suffering when</p>
<p>you go to the third noble truth it's the</p>
<p>mind that he/she is Nirvana not your</p>
<p>body and you look at the fourth noble</p>
<p>truth and it's all training of the mind</p>
<p>certainly ethics has to do with body and</p>
<p>speech but above all is the training of</p>
<p>the mind so the entire framework of the</p>
<p>Buddha Dharma is primarily emphasizing</p>
<p>mind as primary and this is indicated in</p>
<p>the Buddha's own night of his</p>
<p>enlightenment when his first insight</p>
<p>which he said I saw with direct</p>
<p>perception was seeing countless of his</p>
<p>own past lives he said I saw it with</p>
<p>direct perception second watch of the</p>
<p>night I watched countless past lives of</p>
<p>other sentient beings and then he saw</p>
<p>the interrelationship what we called the</p>
<p>laws of karma the interrelationship that</p>
<p>is not just scattered or stochastic</p>
<p>random going from here to there</p>
<p>but there's causality from former to</p>
<p>later and so this is a starting insight</p>
<p>it is necessary we're proceeding further</p>
<p>on his auction path but it's also</p>
<p>crucial they're enlightened eater in the</p>
<p>Pali Canon the tera vaada all of my an</p>
<p>olive Adrianna is there in Chan and in</p>
<p>Zen and then we have the world view that</p>
<p>we're very familiar with especially in a</p>
<p>very educated city like Boston and</p>
<p>Cambridge where if I can paraphrase a</p>
<p>very common view nowadays all phenomena</p>
<p>as in all experiences are preceded by</p>
<p>the brain issue forth from the brain and</p>
<p>consists of the brain but between the</p>
<p>mind and the brain the brain is primary</p>
<p>and in the immortal words of John John</p>
<p>Searle and many others the mind is what</p>
<p>the brain does and if you're having any</p>
<p>kind of mental problem well it's</p>
<p>basically a brain problem and so they</p>
<p>turned it entirely on the head on his</p>
<p>head and could not be more diametrically</p>
<p>opposed so somebody is flamboyantly</p>
<p>wrong and if we are objective and</p>
<p>open-minded about this the Buddha</p>
<p>himself was having basically a</p>
<p>hallucinations on the might of at night</p>
<p>of his enlightenment and Buddhism has</p>
<p>basically been fundamentally psychotic</p>
<p>ever since that's a logical possibility</p>
<p>it is a logical possibility that they</p>
<p>just you know it's pre-scientific is</p>
<p>superstitious it's hocus pocus mumbo</p>
<p>jumbo and claptrap I've heard all of</p>
<p>these attributed to the Buddhist</p>
<p>teachings that's a possibility or the</p>
<p>other possibility is that for the last</p>
<p>hundred and fifty years science has been</p>
<p>profoundly led astray by the dogma of</p>
<p>scientific materialism there's is it's</p>
<p>it's a prelude to the juicy bit so you</p>
<p>have to bear with me if you will you can</p>
<p>back out in a minute there's a fella</p>
<p>named Daniel Simpson I'm looking forward</p>
<p>to meeting we've course founded back and</p>
<p>forth he wrote a very provocative</p>
<p>article called Buddhist meditation and</p>
<p>cognitive sciences daniel simpson</p>
<p>buddhist meditation cognitive sciences</p>
<p>and find it online is worth reading he</p>
<p>did a lot of good research and I quote</p>
<p>him here he says one minor life</p>
<p>scientist Richard Davidson was a very</p>
<p>dear friend of mine a wonderful human</p>
<p>being very bright scientist and just a</p>
<p>very fine human being all together very</p>
<p>good heart I've known him enough for 20</p>
<p>more than 20 years</p>
<p>one minor life scientists bridge</p>
<p>Davidson has bent over backwards to</p>
<p>avoid causing a fence while defending</p>
<p>materialism he acknowledges being asked</p>
<p>quote sharply but respectfully by the</p>
<p>Dalai Lama to quote distinguished</p>
<p>between that which has been empirically</p>
<p>confirmed and that which is simply</p>
<p>assumed and has become part of our</p>
<p>conceptual theoretical and conceptual</p>
<p>dogma</p>
<p>so as Holland is kind of call them on</p>
<p>the carpet so what do you guys really</p>
<p>know which is backed by empirical</p>
<p>evidence and what are you simply simply</p>
<p>accepting out of pure site tradition</p>
<p>theoretical and conceptual dogma so as</p>
<p>holiness can be tough in a very</p>
<p>benevolent respectful way but tough and</p>
<p>so rigid he evidently commanded this and</p>
<p>yet as as Daniel Simpson says yet he'd</p>
<p>Richard Davidson feels obliged to note</p>
<p>that quote certain scientific</p>
<p>assumptions are themselves based on</p>
<p>well-established principles adding says</p>
<p>daniel simpson via the circum</p>
<p>circumlocution some would say so Richard</p>
<p>Davidson distanced herself a little bit</p>
<p>from what he's about to say not much</p>
<p>that the dependence of them of mind on</p>
<p>brain is one such assumption that has</p>
<p>been subjected to countless empirical</p>
<p>tests and each and every one of them has</p>
<p>provided support for this general claim</p>
<p>so that would imply that some point in</p>
<p>the past there was some really</p>
<p>compelling physical evidence empirical</p>
<p>evidence that showed that the mind and</p>
<p>this refers to the whole bandwidth of</p>
<p>states of consciousness that all of them</p>
<p>are dependent on on the brain or to</p>
<p>quote John Searle again the mind is what</p>
<p>brain does the brain is primary in the</p>
<p>mind is just what the brain does is a</p>
<p>function that equality and epiphenomena</p>
<p>of the brain so one would think well</p>
<p>they do have some really strong</p>
<p>empirical evidence for that</p>
<p>unfortunately that's not true at all and</p>
<p>so as much as I love Ritchie and</p>
<p>respected in so many different ways this</p>
<p>is a flamboyantly misleading statement</p>
<p>that is ever since about 1963 when the</p>
<p>term neuroscience was coined by a man</p>
<p>named Schmidt Schmidt</p>
<p>a biologist at MIT she coined the term</p>
<p>and he and some of his contemporaries</p>
<p>back in the early 60s</p>
<p>they started the discipline they coined</p>
<p>the term neuroscience and they started</p>
<p>the discipline of neuroscience at MIT</p>
<p>and the first college that actually had</p>
<p>an undergraduate major in neuroscience</p>
<p>was my alma mater Amherst College 1973</p>
<p>but what was remarkable about the</p>
<p>origins of modern neuroscience is this</p>
<p>man Schmidt was trained as a biologist</p>
<p>he had no training in philosophy of mind</p>
<p>or psychology had no training in the</p>
<p>mind at all he was trained only in</p>
<p>chemistry biology physics and they</p>
<p>simply he and his contemporaries fifty</p>
<p>years ago simply decided that they would</p>
<p>stop start using the term mind and brain</p>
<p>interchangeably and act as if the</p>
<p>mind-body problem had been solved they</p>
<p>haven't even actually made any headway</p>
<p>there was actually no evidence</p>
<p>whatsoever that the mind is nothing more</p>
<p>than a function of the brain they just</p>
<p>started talking that way</p>
<p>they just started talking as if the</p>
<p>mind-body problem had been solved how</p>
<p>the mind interacts with the brain and</p>
<p>vice versa it had been somehow solved</p>
<p>whereas it was more like church council</p>
<p>just kinda citing a point of theology</p>
<p>rather than a conclusion drawn on</p>
<p>empirical evidence and what happened has</p>
<p>happened over the last 50 years is a</p>
<p>Society for Neuroscience which is the</p>
<p>you know the Church Council of</p>
<p>neuroscience they've simply decided that</p>
<p>all of our scientific study of the brain</p>
<p>will work with the assumption that the</p>
<p>mind is the brain of the mind as a</p>
<p>function of the brain and any other</p>
<p>theory and any evidence that stands</p>
<p>outside of that or challenges that we</p>
<p>will ignore or ridicule and that's</p>
<p>what's happened for the last 50 years we</p>
<p>will ignore or ridicule any theory of</p>
<p>the mind and the brain that is not</p>
<p>materialistic I love science and I am</p>
<p>deeply saddened by this travesty of</p>
<p>science because Ricci implies here that</p>
<p>the theory the hypothesis that the mind</p>
<p>is simply the function of the brain has</p>
<p>been tested time and time again and has</p>
<p>always come out positive but that's not</p>
<p>even remotely true I've looked for 25</p>
<p>years at scientific study science</p>
<p>scientific theory</p>
<p>of the mind and reductionistic ones</p>
<p>materialistic ones and interestingly</p>
<p>they they differ a lot but they all have</p>
<p>something in common not one of them is</p>
<p>scientifically testable or has ever been</p>
<p>tested scientifically they simply assume</p>
<p>it's a matter of belief so this is</p>
<p>really quite a travesty I would call it</p>
<p>a scam a hoax</p>
<p>I would call it brain washing because I</p>
<p>think it's most literally correct is</p>
<p>that that which is a very real problem</p>
<p>and which Donald Donald Hoffman a very</p>
<p>good neuroscientist at University of</p>
<p>california-irvine he commented very</p>
<p>cogently that ever since the late 19th</p>
<p>century at a time of Thomas Huxley the</p>
<p>founder of the Church of scientific</p>
<p>materialism there's actually been no</p>
<p>progress at all on solving the mind-body</p>
<p>problem we know that the two are</p>
<p>correlated but how are they correlated</p>
<p>how does the placebo effect work how do</p>
<p>chemicals electricity in the brain</p>
<p>generate or even influence the mind how</p>
<p>do our thoughts our emotions our desires</p>
<p>and aspirations how do they influence</p>
<p>the brain we are as ignorant now as we</p>
<p>were 150 years ago and this is what</p>
<p>happens when you pretend to have</p>
<p>knowledge where all you have is belief</p>
<p>is called an illusion of knowledge and</p>
<p>historically has been the greatest</p>
<p>impediment to scientific discovery</p>
<p>imagine that you know something that</p>
<p>would in fact you only believe and that</p>
<p>is the standard view in modern</p>
<p>psychology neuroscience and philosophy</p>
<p>of mind 90% of them are all materialists</p>
<p>and they simply assume that if you don't</p>
<p>believe that you're either ignorant or</p>
<p>stupid so this is a great challenge this</p>
<p>is great empirical challenge it's not a</p>
<p>battle of science and religion or</p>
<p>Buddhism versus science it's actually</p>
<p>rather on the contrary a challenge</p>
<p>between empiricism and closed-minded</p>
<p>dogmatism and Buddhist can be as</p>
<p>dogmatic and closed-minded as anybody</p>
<p>else but I'm sorry to say I found</p>
<p>scientists can be as dogmatic and</p>
<p>closed-minded as any religious</p>
<p>fundamentalist I've ever met and so our</p>
<p>salvation here if I may speak in an</p>
<p>evangelical way is a return to</p>
<p>experience a return to empiricism but</p>
<p>not exclude first-person experience</p>
<p>because about a hundred years ago with a</p>
<p>rise behavioral psychology there was a</p>
<p>decision</p>
<p>again not a discovery but as this is</p>
<p>decision we will no longer we behavioral</p>
<p>psychologists will no longer refer to</p>
<p>subjective experience of any kind will</p>
<p>never speak of consciousness and we will</p>
<p>not ever use introspection so imagine at</p>
<p>the time of Galileo if the church had</p>
<p>gotten really heavy-handed and said we</p>
<p>can talk about the views of the sale of</p>
<p>you know the stars and planets but never</p>
<p>look through a telescope that's they did</p>
<p>not succeed but the materialists have</p>
<p>succeeded in banishing introspection</p>
<p>from academic psychology let alone</p>
<p>cognitive neuroscience for the last</p>
<p>hundred years it's been quite a shame</p>
<p>and so to the rescue as science I</p>
<p>believe I'm speaking with some passion</p>
<p>here but joyfulness as well Buddhism</p>
<p>also falls into dogmatism in tradition</p>
<p>into close-minded sectarianism it does</p>
<p>people do that whether they're Marxists</p>
<p>or the Republicans and so forth and so</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>we do that science can help rescue</p>
<p>Buddhism from falling into close-minded</p>
<p>traditionalism and ritualism and</p>
<p>complacency it can help us return to</p>
<p>empiricism we've got a great tradition</p>
<p>of empiricism going back to the Buddha</p>
<p>and the Buddhist can rescue the mind</p>
<p>sciences further from the complacency of</p>
<p>thinking they've already solved the my</p>
<p>problem my body problem even to the</p>
<p>point of absurdity like some</p>
<p>neuroscientist saying consciousness</p>
<p>doesn't exist there's no mind-body</p>
<p>problem because there's no mind or one</p>
<p>renowned philosophers mine saying</p>
<p>appearances don't exist if you take that</p>
<p>take those statements versus the</p>
<p>statement that the universe is ten</p>
<p>thousand years old and human beings</p>
<p>existed out on the sixth day pretty much</p>
<p>like us now which is more absurd</p>
<p>forty-two percent of Americans believe</p>
<p>that creationism eighteen percent</p>
<p>believe that the Sun goes around the</p>
<p>earth but what's more absurd those views</p>
<p>are the views that introspection is</p>
<p>impossible that subjective experiences</p>
<p>don't exist because they're not physical</p>
<p>consciousness that self doesn't exist</p>
<p>and appearances don't exist I think the</p>
<p>sight of materialism has pushed the</p>
<p>furthest limits of absurdity so we come</p>
<p>back to sanity that the mind does exist</p>
<p>is enormous ly efficacious and in fact</p>
<p>upon very careful and</p>
<p>you may very well draw the conclusion</p>
<p>that it is primary but now the</p>
<p>ontological burden so to speak what is</p>
<p>primary in the universe in the Buddhist</p>
<p>view from the Pali Canon right through</p>
<p>its open the mind is of paramount</p>
<p>importance the course mind what we</p>
<p>divide enta Phi is the psyche clearly</p>
<p>that's dependent upon the body but</p>
<p>that's not been doubted for millennia</p>
<p>when the Buddha himself practice ascetic</p>
<p>practices for six years he let his</p>
<p>health really really get damaged he was</p>
<p>weak emaciated and he saw that his mind</p>
<p>had become weak and he recognized he had</p>
<p>to restore his physical strength and</p>
<p>health for his mind to bounce back and</p>
<p>be strong and resilient so this it</p>
<p>didn't no mystery since the time of the</p>
<p>Buddha but that's the most superficial</p>
<p>level of mind zouk chen the whole</p>
<p>buddhist tradition is at large and the</p>
<p>so Qin tradition in particular invites</p>
<p>us go beneath the surface investigate</p>
<p>the nature of mind the primacy of mind</p>
<p>and some physicists are coming to the</p>
<p>same conclusion after all what we do</p>
<p>what do we know most immediately is</p>
<p>information appearances in information</p>
<p>and appearances are not physical and the</p>
<p>very categories of mind of mind matter</p>
<p>space time energy they're all conceptual</p>
<p>constructs based on information</p>
<p>informations not physical so which</p>
<p>brings us back to zouk Chen there's the</p>
<p>first point it's not Dogma it's not a</p>
<p>catechism it's not you have to believe</p>
<p>this but you must investigate until you</p>
<p>come to some uncertainty is the mind</p>
<p>primary or not and if it is alright</p>
<p>that's something big but then a</p>
<p>brilliant stroke and we see this running</p>
<p>through all of duty on linguistic</p>
<p>teachings oh my goodness that twenty</p>
<p>minutes go by</p>
<p>is that possible no that was supposed to</p>
<p>be the prelude can I go a little bit</p>
<p>longer okay at least have to give this</p>
<p>that was really fast amazing but I</p>
<p>warned I warned Daniel I do that but now</p>
<p>that you see mine is primary then the</p>
<p>next in the strategy this path in zou</p>
<p>Chen is not universally true in all</p>
<p>schools of Buddhism now investigate the</p>
<p>nature of the mind that which apprehends</p>
<p>that which knows that which observes</p>
<p>observe the nature of the agent the mind</p>
<p>that meditates that gets upset that</p>
<p>becomes compassionate engages in virtue</p>
<p>nonvirtue investigate this all creating</p>
<p>sovereign the mind and what does he say</p>
<p>here back to mutton feathers again in a</p>
<p>visionary experience a being and</p>
<p>appearing in one of his dreams since son</p>
<p>of the claw of the clear light Vadra</p>
<p>essence addressing digital mingi says</p>
<p>your own mind is the basis of all</p>
<p>samsara and Nirvana the origin from</p>
<p>which it first emerges is empty the</p>
<p>location in which it resides in the</p>
<p>interim after it's arisen before passes</p>
<p>is empty the destination to which it</p>
<p>finally goes is empty perceive the</p>
<p>essential nature of emptiness it this</p>
<p>mind it has no form shape color or</p>
<p>source it is neither one nor many and it</p>
<p>is neither emanated nor reabsorbed it</p>
<p>transcends the parameters of existence</p>
<p>and non-existence it is empty of the</p>
<p>conventional words of negation and</p>
<p>affirmation it is spontaneously</p>
<p>actualized as great emptiness since I</p>
<p>said I would be punctual I'm gonna wrap</p>
<p>up that rather long juicy quote is that</p>
<p>no way I could finished in just a few</p>
<p>minutes here's a strategy I was asked by</p>
<p>one friend of mine to give a bit of</p>
<p>pointing out instructions all right</p>
<p>let's give it give it you take a crack</p>
<p>at wean strategy here it's all very well</p>
<p>to speak profound words and be citing</p>
<p>great masters and so forth but when we</p>
<p>return home if we're inspired by this</p>
<p>path of the great protection how can we</p>
<p>get up on our lovely little</p>
<p>legs and start walking on the path I'll</p>
<p>sit make a suggestion okay but I would</p>
<p>suggest for those of us living in cities</p>
<p>like Boston I live in the outskirts of</p>
<p>Los Angeles I visit cities all over the</p>
<p>world we all know it in this modern era</p>
<p>with this way of life with this amount</p>
<p>of information this amount of</p>
<p>stimulation we have the amount of</p>
<p>workload we have the demands on our</p>
<p>attention that we have we are running an</p>
<p>experiment on ourselves and I think is</p>
<p>quite a cruel experiment to see how far</p>
<p>we can be pushed without all of us going</p>
<p>insane the first thing as we had in the</p>
<p>preliminary exercise to learn in a</p>
<p>non-trivial way how to set your body</p>
<p>speech mind at ease no wonder MBSR</p>
<p>mindfulness based stress reduction is so</p>
<p>popular and so helpful because people</p>
<p>are desperate to get some relief from</p>
<p>strain and stress that's just wearing</p>
<p>them out and sapping all the joy from</p>
<p>their lives so to learn through</p>
<p>discipline how to set the body and mind</p>
<p>at ease mindfulness breathing is</p>
<p>marvelous with it settle settle body</p>
<p>speech and mind at ease and then</p>
<p>mindfulness breathing full body</p>
<p>awareness let your awareness permeate</p>
<p>the whole field of the body but in the</p>
<p>midst of that that's already take a</p>
<p>little step towards zouk jam the great</p>
<p>perfection and that is while attending</p>
<p>to the sensations corresponding to or</p>
<p>correlated with the respiration</p>
<p>throughout the entire body kind of the</p>
<p>flow of energy through the body</p>
<p>corresponding to or related to the</p>
<p>respiration while attending to the</p>
<p>movements within the body corresponding</p>
<p>to the respiration attend to this from a</p>
<p>place of stillness your awareness your</p>
<p>mental awareness resting in stillness</p>
<p>while simultaneously attending to the</p>
<p>flux the ebb and flow of the sensations</p>
<p>of the breath throughout the body</p>
<p>stillness and movement stillness and</p>
<p>movement simultaneously as you calm as</p>
<p>the mind stabilizes as the clarity of</p>
<p>the mind like the Sun rising over the</p>
<p>horizon the clarity that might becomes</p>
<p>clearer and clearer but make a segue</p>
<p>into a practice it's called by various</p>
<p>names one is simply observing the mind</p>
<p>again from a vantage point of stillness</p>
<p>direct your attention now single point</p>
<ul>
<li>one out of six domains of experience</li>
</ul>
<p>the domain of mental events of thoughts</p>
<p>of memories mental images the same</p>
<p>domain in which dreams arise at night</p>
<p>but also subjective impulses like</p>
<p>desires and emotions and from the</p>
<p>vantage of stillness of clarity of</p>
<p>stillness awareness that is at ease</p>
<p>still and clear observe the theater of</p>
<p>the mind the comings and goings of</p>
<p>thoughts emotions memories fantasies and</p>
<p>so forth coming and going arising in the</p>
<p>space of the mind resolving back into</p>
<p>that space and observe it in an ongoing</p>
<p>way from that vantage point of stillness</p>
<p>without wit called psychologist called</p>
<p>cognitive fusion without getting caught</p>
<p>up and carried away by the memories the</p>
<p>desires the emotions and so on and then</p>
<p>as you go deeper look to the intervals</p>
<p>between thoughts attend to the very</p>
<p>space that the mind itself and it then</p>
<p>clearly discerning ly observe what is</p>
<p>the nature of this space is it physical</p>
<p>space this is the face of the mind does</p>
<p>it have color does it have shape does</p>
<p>that have a center of periphery is that</p>
<p>have form does it have any physical</p>
<p>qualities whatsoever observe it closely</p>
<p>the very space of the mind and then as</p>
<p>we move in that in this strategy this is</p>
<p>now a very condensed course as you're</p>
<p>able to maintain that flow of clear</p>
<p>discerning awareness of the space of the</p>
<p>mind and observing also how thoughts</p>
<p>emerge from that space not emerging from</p>
<p>neurons which is a crazy idea</p>
<p>the notion of dreams and motion coming</p>
<p>from chemicals electricity one of the</p>
<p>craziest ideas I've ever heard but it's</p>
<p>groupthink one person says that a bunch</p>
<p>of people say it ok dispense with that</p>
<p>nonsense you can see thoughts arising</p>
<p>from the space of the mind and</p>
<p>dissolving back into the space of the</p>
<p>mind and the thoughts are non-physical</p>
<p>than the space that the mind is</p>
<p>non-physical</p>
<p>get over it you know and let this be</p>
<p>incorporated into the scientific study</p>
<p>of the mind we've been ignoring</p>
<p>first-person perspective for a hundred</p>
<p>and fifty years it's time to stop as</p>
<p>they say in Italy basta enough already</p>
<p>let's be scientific in the study of the</p>
<p>mind by observing it carefully like all</p>
<p>other branches of science observe</p>
<p>carefully the phenomena they're trying</p>
<p>to seek to understand don't you study</p>
<p>brain and behavior</p>
<p>so observe this based of the might and</p>
<p>now do something very clever with draw</p>
<p>the vector of your attention and</p>
<p>withdraw right into the very nature of</p>
<p>being aware itself have no</p>
<p>directionality no vector no object of</p>
<p>attention outside of awareness itself</p>
<p>and simply rest in an ongoing flow of</p>
<p>awareness of being aware consciousness</p>
<p>of consciousness itself it makes common</p>
<p>sense that if you want to understand</p>
<p>something look at it closely for a</p>
<p>sustained period</p>
<p>that's how Galileo discovered the moons</p>
<p>of Jupiter and sunspots and the phases</p>
<p>of Venus and craters on the moon he</p>
<p>observed carefully and in the sustained</p>
<p>fashion and started the scientific</p>
<p>revolution it's high time for the first</p>
<p>revolution and the mine Sciences to</p>
<p>begin but that means we have to do what</p>
<p>Galileo did what Galileo did what Darwin</p>
<p>did and what William James did look</p>
<p>carefully at the phenomena you're</p>
<p>seeking to understand observe</p>
<p>consciousness naked ly without mediation</p>
<p>we're almost there that's called</p>
<p>schemata it's a sus lesson most profound</p>
<p>method of schemata there isn't a whole</p>
<p>Buddhist tradition the awareness of</p>
<p>being conscious itself and now one step</p>
<p>further and we'll slip into the domain</p>
<p>absorption now carefully incisively</p>
<p>observe that which is observing we call</p>
<p>it the mind observe the mind we call it</p>
<p>awareness</p>
<p>observe awareness observe that which is</p>
<p>aware that which thinks that which</p>
<p>intends observe the observer and cut</p>
<p>through the mind right down to the very</p>
<p>ground which is Ripa and xoJane</p>
<p>meditation is nothing more or less than</p>
<p>cutting through to pristine awareness</p>
<p>rickwaa and viewing reality from that</p>
<p>perspective and that right there is the</p>
<p>view of the great production so in your</p>
<p>practice I just gave you enough to keep</p>
<p>you busy for at least few days</p>
<p>in your practice when you come to the</p>
<p>end there when you're coming to the</p>
<p>where you're able to sustain a flow of</p>
<p>awareness of awareness and then you cut</p>
<p>through the flow of awareness of</p>
<p>awareness to the penetration to that</p>
<p>which is aware you know the distinction</p>
<p>between the awareness that gets</p>
<p>distracted and gets dull and get</p>
<p>centered and gets distracted again and</p>
<p>that's the mind but as you cut through</p>
<p>to that which is aware you may cut</p>
<p>through to a dimension of awareness that</p>
<p>is unborn and unceasing that never moves</p>
<p>because it's not in time it's unchanging</p>
<p>and you can never wrap your conceptual</p>
<p>mind around it because this baseline</p>
<p>this ground of awareness from which all</p>
<p>conditioned states of consciousness</p>
<p>emerge transcends a very parameters of</p>
<p>existence and non-existence it</p>
<p>transcends all conceptual categories it</p>
<p>can be known is not an ultimate mystery</p>
<p>it can be known directly without</p>
<p>mediation but only by itself it can know</p>
<p>itself but your conceptual mind cannot</p>
<p>grasp it it's beyond its paygrade it's</p>
<p>beyond its scope so this rig by this</p>
<p>pristine awareness it is present right</p>
<p>now it is where your awareness it is it</p>
<p>is where your thoughts are it is not</p>
<p>something separate it's not somebody</p>
<p>else's it's not gods or Buddha's or some</p>
<p>other persons it's the ground state of</p>
<p>your own awareness and not and then this</p>
<p>node hidden in plain sight so try that</p>
<p>see what happened thank you so much</p>
<p>so the best question is what is the</p>
<p>difference between the shaman to</p>
<p>practice of awareness of awareness and</p>
<p>the practice of trencher very good I</p>
<p>could draw for my own background here</p>
<p>but I'd rather draw from the explicit</p>
<p>answer to that question from from and so</p>
<p>this question was posed to him last fall</p>
<p>and his answer in fact I think I was one</p>
<p>maybe I was one that I think I might</p>
<p>have been I wanted to get just</p>
<p>razor-sharp clarity and I did and so</p>
<p>here's the answer and that is anyone can</p>
<p>practice awareness of awareness you can</p>
<p>be a materialist a Christian an agnostic</p>
<p>Muslim Buddhist anything you like it has</p>
<p>no theory had no viewer that goes with</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>it's technology some of this technology</p>
<p>is contempt into technology the passion</p>
<p>is contemplative science and to become</p>
<p>the vidyadhara or practice that</p>
<p>meditation is very deep science and so</p>
<p>to practice awareness of awareness is</p>
<p>simply resting in the flow this</p>
<p>phenomenological or expansion flow of</p>
<p>being aware that's all there is to it</p>
<p>but now you may use the same method and</p>
<p>that is just be resting in the flow of</p>
<p>awareness</p>
<p>perhaps observing that which is aware</p>
<p>but if you cut through the conditioned</p>
<p>mind this mind that is arising from</p>
<p>moment a moment that is conditioned by</p>
<p>many many causes and additions that</p>
<p>becomes virtuous and non-virtuous dull</p>
<p>and clear and so forth if you cut</p>
<p>through this fluctuating and conditioned</p>
<p>mind you cut through that it's texture</p>
<p>it means cutting through something rigid</p>
<p>and gnarly and cut through to the ground</p>
<p>then and you're actually are viewing</p>
<p>reality from the perspective of Ripa</p>
<p>that's your vantage point the method is</p>
<p>the same but because you're viewing</p>
<p>reality from the perspective of rikta</p>
<p>the method is now textured so the same</p>
<p>method without the view is schemata with</p>
<p>the view is textured</p>
<p>so far over ordinary experience we know</p>
<p>that physical brief affects our mind</p>
<p>let's say the body's tired and drink</p>
<p>your coffee we know it affects the</p>
<p>clarity and so on so we see that cause</p>
<p>and effect of correlation so are you</p>
<p>saying that Britten effects let's say</p>
<p>mind or ordinary parts a battle alone</p>
<p>Kristina marinus that is independent of</p>
<p>the brain there's a very clear</p>
<p>demarcation within the suction tradition</p>
<p>but I've seen it elsewhere as well of</p>
<p>three dimensions of mind and what</p>
<p>psychologists study is what the</p>
<p>Buddhists call and the skull including</p>
<p>Freud and Freud for sure and modern</p>
<p>cogman psychology affective psychology</p>
<p>and cognitive science when they refer to</p>
<p>mind it's what Buddhists call course</p>
<p>mind course mind and this is the mind</p>
<p>and not only mental awareness but also</p>
<p>visual perception auditory and so forth</p>
<p>so course mind includes the five</p>
<p>physical senses and mental the mind as</p>
<p>in this this phenomenon this faculty</p>
<p>that by which we remember think imagine</p>
<p>hope fear and so forth and this arises</p>
<p>in dependence upon the brain right and</p>
<p>this been known but it's this is not</p>
<p>breaking news this has been known for a</p>
<p>very long time damage the brain and you</p>
<p>afferent Fred mine had his optic nerve</p>
<p>damage</p>
<p>now he's blind in one eye okay visual</p>
<p>cortex is fine but one little part the</p>
<p>optic nerve is damaged now he's blind in</p>
<p>one eye and likewise with Alzheimer's</p>
<p>with Lou Gehrig's disease with brain</p>
<p>trauma with schizophrenia with genetic</p>
<p>with with mental imbalances that may</p>
<p>have a genetic influence all of these</p>
<p>are influencing the brain but also</p>
<p>through mental training de viously</p>
<p>exercising the mind so neurogenesis</p>
<p>kicks in we know this a very strong</p>
<p>correlations and here neuroscience is</p>
<p>providing a very great service in in</p>
<p>highlighting many of these strong</p>
<p>correlations we also know as a thought</p>
<p>experiment</p>
<p>I'll do it on myself so I won't seem</p>
<p>mean to others if I take a mallet with a</p>
<p>hammer and I just start hitting my head</p>
<p>with it very hard</p>
<p>I'll start losing one faculty after</p>
<p>another after another until I'm dead and</p>
<p>that would look like but you damage the</p>
<p>mine a little bit and then more and more</p>
<p>and now you really sledgehammer it and</p>
<p>I'm no longer breathing and now the</p>
<p>brain is now finished if you're studying</p>
<p>the brain of studying the mind only from</p>
<p>physical perspective the very reasonable</p>
<p>conclusion would be look damaged be in a</p>
<p>little bit and you go blind or you can't</p>
<p>remember remember as well or if you have</p>
<p>emotional bipolarity or what have you</p>
<p>damaged it more you're more mentally</p>
<p>impaired and damaged that a whole lot</p>
<p>you don't have a mind anymore</p>
<p>this is a very natural reasonable</p>
<p>conclusion if you're looking at the mind</p>
<p>from only the outside but in a way it's</p>
<p>not breaking news we've known this for a</p>
<p>very long time and so in that dimension</p>
<p>of the mind why the Buddha needed to get</p>
<p>some a good meal and restore his health</p>
<p>to be true enlightenment this was a</p>
<p>message from the very beginning as a</p>
<p>Buddhism but with there's something in</p>
<p>between this mind which psychologists</p>
<p>have studied indirectly by way of brain</p>
<p>behavior and questionnaires and the</p>
<p>Buddhist content ative Hindu Christian</p>
<p>Sufi and so forth have examined very</p>
<p>rigorously from a first-person</p>
<p>perspective there's something between</p>
<p>this mind was definitely my mind I'm 67</p>
<p>my mind did not exist 68 years ago Alan</p>
<p>Wallace at mind nowhere in the universe</p>
<p>and 68 years from now I think is a very</p>
<p>safe bet Alan's mind will not exist</p>
<p>anywhere in the universe because this</p>
<p>person's mind is arising upon</p>
<p>independence upon this person brain</p>
<p>damage it and there are consequences but</p>
<p>is that all there is to it</p>
<p>I call if one concludes well what we</p>
<p>study it is all there is I call that a</p>
<p>flat mind a perspective like Flat Earth</p>
<p>there's a flat mind because by and large</p>
<p>academic psychology neuroscientists are</p>
<p>studying only normal people and mentally</p>
<p>impaired in brain damage brain damaged</p>
<p>people and when they do study meditators</p>
<p>they studied their brains and behavior</p>
<p>you know this like trying to understand</p>
<p>meditation by step understanding</p>
<p>mathematics by studying studying math</p>
<p>math mathematician brains it's not</p>
<p>really a very skillful approach and so</p>
<p>when you shut down the mind that is you</p>
<p>deactivate the mind what we call it</p>
<p>falling asleep and the course mind is</p>
<p>inactive in non lucid stage for non REM</p>
<p>sleep deep asleep you don't explicitly</p>
<p>know anything at all</p>
<p>you're not even that you're asleep so</p>
<p>many many psychologists think then</p>
<p>you're totally unconscious I beg to</p>
<p>differ</p>
<p>you have no explicit consciousness but</p>
<p>there's an implicit flow of</p>
<p>consciousness and we call that the</p>
<p>substrate consciousness or the alive it</p>
<p>Nana from the so Chen perspective but of</p>
<p>course we don't get normally get to</p>
<p>enjoy it because we're not explicitly</p>
<p>aware of it</p>
<p>but it is possible to be lucid in</p>
<p>dreamless sleep you can be in deep</p>
<p>dreamless sleep and know it that is</p>
<p>definitely possible</p>
<p>just like lucid dreaming is possible</p>
<p>this is possible we enter into this</p>
<p>state and substrate consciousness when</p>
<p>we fall deep asleep this is AB evanka</p>
<p>and the tera vaada tradition when you go</p>
<p>comatose you faint you achieve schemata</p>
<p>and you die but among those various</p>
<p>options about four of them would just</p>
<p>happen naturally schemata you access</p>
<p>that same dimension of consciousness but</p>
<p>you do so with increasing clarity as</p>
<p>you're proceeding along the path to</p>
<p>access to the first jhana so when you</p>
<p>arrive there it is radiantly clear like</p>
<p>moving from a 10 watt bulb to a thousand</p>
<p>watt bulb and that dimension of</p>
<p>consciousness in the Buddhist view and</p>
<p>this is I apophysis but not a Dogma or</p>
<p>it can be then it's boring but as an</p>
<p>empirical hypothesis this is ruling this</p>
<p>dimension of consciousness is one that</p>
<p>carries on from lifetime to lifetime and</p>
<p>it not the brain is the repository of</p>
<p>memories the virtual tendencies and so</p>
<p>forth and that's a testable hypothesis</p>
<p>and how is it tested tradin a number of</p>
<p>people to achieve summative to rest in</p>
<p>that substrate consciousness which is</p>
<p>not contingent upon the brain perceive</p>
<p>the brain carries on after brain death</p>
<p>it in the Buddhist view is the</p>
<p>repository of memories predilections</p>
<p>habits abilities and so forth and so on</p>
<p>so here's a very simple test unlike all</p>
<p>of the scientific theories that are</p>
<p>rooted in materialism none of which can</p>
<p>be tested or have been tested utterly</p>
<p>contrary to what Ricci implied at least</p>
<p>other people say this is a testable</p>
<p>hypothesis a scientific hypothesis train</p>
<p>a number people the more the better</p>
<p>to achieve schemata and then following</p>
<p>the teachings of Buddha ghosts of 1500</p>
<p>years ago a great tera vaada commentator</p>
<p>takes that people at least with sha Mata</p>
<p>even better if they've achieved higher</p>
<p>states of Samadhi and then have them</p>
<p>direct their attention to the path</p>
<p>and see if they can retrieve vertically</p>
<p>memories from their youth their</p>
<p>childhood which is said to be true you</p>
<p>can do that and then ask a 66 year old</p>
<p>not this one but somebody else there's a</p>
<p>chief schemata say now what you recall</p>
<p>now that you're you're you're accessing</p>
<p>true memories from the time you're four</p>
<p>and three and two years old now okay mr.</p>
<p>Wallace was the chief janitor</p>
<p>hypothetically purely huh</p>
<p>now what when you direct the laser of</p>
<p>your attention because you've got an</p>
<p>attention it's like a laser now direct</p>
<p>it to where whirring what were you</p>
<p>experiencing sixty-eight years ago</p>
<p>perfectly good question and there are</p>
<p>three possibility logical possibilities</p>
<p>the shona tete-a-tete one who actually</p>
<p>achieved it says I'm sorry I'm coming</p>
<p>with a blank screen no data the</p>
<p>materialist would say I told you so</p>
<p>another one to come up with come up with</p>
<p>I remember this I remember this and is</p>
<p>all fantasy just fantasy you know I was</p>
<p>Cleopatra I was Napoleon yeah maybe but</p>
<p>there's a third possibility the person</p>
<p>comes up the memories and they're tested</p>
<p>scientifically by open-minded critical</p>
<p>skeptical scientists or anybody else and</p>
<p>say okay who were what is your memory oh</p>
<p>you were this old man living in Buenos</p>
<p>Aires</p>
<p>tell us more and then they do</p>
<p>investigation they into an investigation</p>
<p>investigation and there is a way to</p>
<p>empirically put to the test which has</p>
<p>been done thousands of times already</p>
<p>within the Buddhist and Hindu tradition</p>
<p>and Taoist traditions do it in the</p>
<p>monitor scientific context there's a</p>
<p>dimension of consciousness that is not</p>
<p>brain dependent and it's out of that</p>
<p>continuum of consciousness that might</p>
<p>emerges so we asked for what are the</p>
<p>origins of mind is not neurons it's not</p>
<p>synapses dendrite 2d glial cells as some</p>
<p>as hugly said this is like pulling a</p>
<p>genie out of a lamp</p>
<p>it's magical thinking or Giulio Tononi a</p>
<p>neuroscientist at university of</p>
<p>wisconsin said this is like a macula</p>
<p>conception the thing that chemicals</p>
<p>electricity actually give rise to</p>
<p>subjective experience I've studied</p>
<p>physics it's it's a wacko physics they</p>
<p>know a lot of physicists know a lot</p>
<p>about matter and energy there's no</p>
<p>suggestion anywhere that they give rise</p>
<p>to dreams</p>
<p>it's a silly idea that's become</p>
<p>commonplace Britta is another order of</p>
<p>magnitude beyond that Ripa is</p>
<p>transcended substrate consciousness is</p>
<p>present era it's within the realm of</p>
<p>deep psychology they say transpersonal</p>
<p>psychology but empirical but for that</p>
<p>you need to develop the appropriate</p>
<p>technology and that shaman to realize</p>
<p>the empty nature of mind you need the</p>
<p>passion to cut through the conditioned</p>
<p>mind to unconditioned mind</p>
<p>for that you need option the question is</p>
<p>how no what is a relationship between</p>
<p>devotion and specifically group Korea</p>
<p>devotion or Guru yoga and the practice</p>
<p>of zouk Chen what's a relationship how</p>
<p>important is it and insofar as it is</p>
<p>important how do you go about doing it</p>
<p>right generally speaking in all schools</p>
<p>of Buddhism starting with a foundation</p>
<p>Pali Canon the relationship with economy</p>
<p>through the spiritual friend the</p>
<p>spiritual mentor is enormous ly</p>
<p>important it's a guide imagine trying to</p>
<p>learn guitar on your own with no guitar</p>
<p>teacher learning mathematics just by</p>
<p>picking up mathematics books you know</p>
<p>can it be done yellen principle there</p>
<p>are prodigies who just are self-taught</p>
<p>but we know how rare they are so that's</p>
<p>for chemistry for learning medicine</p>
<p>would you like to have have brain</p>
<p>surgery done on yourself by person who</p>
<p>read a lot of books on it and I think I</p>
<p>think I I think I can do it can I try in</p>
<p>your brain you know for any serious</p>
<p>sophisticated level of knowledge you</p>
<p>want a teacher and serious and</p>
<p>sophisticated is a pretty good</p>
<p>characterization of the were Noble</p>
<p>Truths if your aspiration is to be</p>
<p>forever and completely free of all</p>
<p>mental afflictions</p>
<p>that's nothing trivial about that and so</p>
<p>clearly you're gonna be a lot more</p>
<p>effective if you find an authentic</p>
<p>teacher and relate to this person a very</p>
<p>meaningful respectful reverent way but</p>
<p>that's true actually for everything else</p>
<p>too as we move into end in the in the</p>
<p>Tibetan tradition they say if you're</p>
<p>following let's say the shravaka path it</p>
<p>has to become in our heart view your own</p>
<p>teacher as as if he or she were an</p>
<p>emissary or an ambassador of the Buddha</p>
<p>because this is as close to the Buddha</p>
<p>as you're gonna get</p>
<p>the Buddha's 2,500 years ago but this is</p>
<p>an unbroken continuum a lineage a</p>
<p>current</p>
<p>of the teachings and the teacher you</p>
<p>have make sure you choose well the</p>
<p>teacher was authentic is ethical is well</p>
<p>motivated has profound understanding</p>
<p>it's a skillful teacher and is teaching</p>
<p>for one reason only above all one reason</p>
<p>that's compassion if there's any other</p>
<p>motivation for teaching find another</p>
<p>teacher because it's probably not going</p>
<p>to be motivation mistaken be to your</p>
<p>advantage so first of all choose well in</p>
<p>the Mahayana tradition it goes even</p>
<p>deeper now view your teacher as if he or</p>
<p>she were a Buddha as a conduit of the</p>
<p>blessings of dharmakaya or the blessings</p>
<p>of the Buddha as not simply a historical</p>
<p>character but a living presence and so</p>
<p>they're a very deeply spiritual view of</p>
<p>the Buddha mind on acai being everywhere</p>
<p>present but like light coming through a</p>
<p>magnifying glass</p>
<p>really funneled through focusing through</p>
<p>an authentic my own a Buddhist teacher</p>
<p>there's a person with experience of
bodhichitta insight of emptiness some</p>
<p>experience of schemata skillful teacher</p>
<p>knowledgeable experienced and</p>
<p>compassionate when we move into Vaudrey</p>
<p>jana and then specifically zouk chen now</p>
<p>we're doing something quite</p>
<p>extraordinary which makes sense if and</p>
<p>only if one has some genuine insight</p>
<p>into emptiness and genuine intuitive</p>
<p>affirmation is very least of the</p>
<p>omnipresent nature of dharmakaya the</p>
<p>theme that comes in the Utada tantra one</p>
<p>of the five works of Maitreya that the</p>
<p>mine streams of every sense of being are</p>
<p>saturated by Buddha nature saturated by</p>
<p>the mind of the buddha indivisibly</p>
<p>saturated by so we're your guru is where</p>
<p>your gurus mind is there is the</p>
<p>Dharmakaya there is rick but there is</p>
<p>primordial consciousness so then it's a</p>
<p>matter of choice if you're finally in</p>
<p>job chen it's a matter of choice it's</p>
<p>perfectly didn't for example i some</p>
<p>people regard me as their lamas and I</p>
<p>teach Doc Chen so for some people I'm as</p>
<p>OPM Lama does that mean that suddenly</p>
<p>I'm a highly realized perfected being</p>
<p>not even remotely but where I am as</p>
<p>where Daniel is and where is Kestrel is</p>
<p>and anybody else here where you are</p>
<p>there is Buddha mind so I'm gonna say</p>
<p>that where my mind is there is</p>
<p>mind it's true where I am there's also a</p>
<p>sentry beings mind like guy from</p>
<p>California no that's also true where I</p>
<p>am here's my substrate consciousness</p>
<p>carried on from past lies we'll carry on</p>
<p>in the future that's also here so it's</p>
<p>your choice</p>
<p>and it's not an invitation to be a guru</p>
<p>it's just a choice in general that is</p>
<p>you attend to your guru you can if you</p>
<p>wish simply regard your rule is</p>
<p>essentially you could very well be true</p>
<p>you can view that you grow as this</p>
<p>continuum based upon the continuum of</p>
<p>substrate consciousness but you can if</p>
<p>you wish seeing the empty nature of your</p>
<p>guru as a sentient being that there is</p>
<p>nothing from the grooved side that is</p>
<p>inherently a sentient being try to find</p>
<p>it try to find in yourself if you ever</p>
<p>look within and tried to find that</p>
<p>nuclear sentient being that is you and I</p>
<p>think I can guarantee you're not gonna</p>
<p>find it it is conventionally existent</p>
<p>and that's all and so it's a matter of</p>
<p>choice where we never thought he we even</p>
<p>had a choice but we may if we choose</p>
<p>look through the veneer of appearances</p>
<p>which are strongly conditioned by our</p>
<p>own Karma our predilections our beliefs</p>
<p>preconceptions and so forth look through</p>
<p>the veneer of the course mind look</p>
<p>through the veneer of the substrate</p>
<p>consciousness as with x-ray vision look</p>
<p>right down to the core the Buddha nature</p>
<p>that is there where your guru is</p>
<p>dharmakaya that is where there where</p>
<p>your guru is and on that basis designate</p>
<p>this is my guru my guru is a vodka da da</p>
<p>da da da da da da da</p>
<p>Samantha bottom Adi Buddha my guru is</p>
<p>Buddha because where my guru is there is</p>
<p>blood of mind and it's on that basis I'm</p>
<p>identifying my guru and for me my guru</p>
<p>is Buddha but this goes hand in hand we</p>
<p>say well what's the big deal why are you</p>
<p>doing it</p>
<p>well number one you get a lot more</p>
<p>benefit that way but two this is all</p>
<p>preamble as a preparation because the</p>
<p>whole point of Adrienne in general ends</p>
<p>option in particular is to realize when</p>
<p>you cut through the veneer of your own</p>
<p>self preconceptions your ordinary sense</p>
<p>of who you are your ordinary sense of</p>
<p>identity ordinary way of appearing to</p>
<p>yourself cut through that there's</p>
<p>nothing there that exists from its own</p>
<p>side cut through that cut through the</p>
<p>substrate consciousness and know your</p>
<p>own face as rickwaa which has always</p>
<p>been present so the devotion the</p>
<p>reverence the focus on the Guru as</p>
<p>Buddha is really simply the other side</p>
<p>of the coin of coming to know yourself</p>
<p>as a Buddha now in a way it's very</p>
<p>helpful to have an extraordinary teacher</p>
<p>I know Daniels teacher going on image a</p>
<p>extraordinary master and you see such</p>
<p>people as long as the Dalai Lama diggle</p>
<p>consider but you do join room which is</p>
<p>ona [ __ ] a I've met such people in you</p>
<p>standing all of them if you kind of get</p>
<p>them say whoa and what comes with that</p>
<p>is oh boy he's so much not like me you</p>
<p>know when I first met the Dalai Lama</p>
<p>it's like whoa he's my guru but boy is</p>
<p>he not like me and jung junha virtue</p>
<p>vidyadhara oh boy is he not like me you</p>
<p>know and got a temper Qi and other great</p>
<p>teachers the sixteenth karmapa the</p>
<p>current come out awesome beings the</p>
<p>current incarnation renews Malinga young</p>
<p>man awesome and so it's very easy to</p>
<p>feel devotion for these beings who just</p>
<p>manifest to us with majesty with with a</p>
<p>deep sense of the sacred but in so doing</p>
<p>we also have a sense of and then there's</p>
<p>me way down here and it actually can</p>
<p>support or reinforce the sense</p>
<p>aw shucks little old mean but that's not</p>
<p>the point but not the point is not too</p>
<p>agile eight or to revere the grew as an</p>
<p>end in itself all of that is a</p>
<p>preparation for realizing your own mind</p>
<p>as Buddha mind and so in a way it's</p>
<p>actually more potent to have a grew your</p>
<p>root guru is opium master who appears to</p>
<p>you a lot like yourself maybe even the</p>
<p>same skin color to be helpful to have</p>
<p>same gender same country same language</p>
<p>boy you're pretty much like me a little</p>
<p>bit better but pretty much like me</p>
<p>if you can view that person there seems</p>
<p>so similar to yourself if you can cut</p>
<p>through the veneer of that person and</p>
<p>seen that person as a Buddha oh then</p>
<p>you're right next door to recognize your</p>
<p>own nature's Buddha so that's the</p>
<p>advantage of having an ordinary schmuck</p>
<p>who's qualified suk-jin teacher I've</p>
<p>been authorized to teach so check i'm</p>
<p>ordinary schmuck that's who I am</p>
<p>but I've been qualified to teach auction</p>
<p>and I do it with my utmost ability to</p>
<p>not distort the teachings so in that</p>
<p>regard most I think most ocean teachings</p>
<p>are much more teachers are much more</p>
<p>realization Linehan but I the advantage</p>
<p>of being ordinary monk so what is the</p>
<p>sharma to meditation that you are</p>
<p>teaching in this course I suppose are</p>
<p>you supposed to take awareness as an</p>
<p>object or are you supposed to sink back</p>
<p>into subjectivity or something else it's</p>
<p>not so much matter of thinking back that</p>
<p>sounds very closeted ativ or ruminating</p>
<p>it's not that Sochi Ahmed is not really</p>
<p>thinking back into but it's SEM Nilda</p>
<p>baba and that is settling the mind in</p>
<p>its unconditioned state not not</p>
<p>ultimately unconditioned but</p>
<p>unconditioned on a relative sense</p>
<p>resting releasing releasing all grasping</p>
<p>while maintaining the flow of discerning</p>
<p>non conceptual awareness so when we</p>
<p>first start the Shama to practice of</p>
<p>simply observing the mind we're</p>
<p>observing thoughts images memories</p>
<p>coming up dujun Linga comments in the</p>
<p>passage I would have read to you but it</p>
<p>would have taken a lot longer than I</p>
<p>anticipated you're observing in the mind</p>
<p>with the mind the conceptual mind is</p>
<p>observing the conceptual mind so you're</p>
<p>basically in it it's like observing a</p>
<p>swamp with you know with you up to your</p>
<p>neck in the swamp but then as you go</p>
<p>deeper into it the cognitive fusion with</p>
<p>the activities of the mind diminishes</p>
<p>diminishes diminishes and so </p>
<p>dudjom lingpa says it's much more like a shepherd watching his flock out in an open plain while the shepherd sit still while the flock moves hither and yon and so that cognitive fusion is dissipating and the sense of the stillness for awareness as you're observing thoughts you invert your awareness in upon itself but it's still likely your awareness is still very likely to be conditioned by your thoughts your ideas your preconceptions your beliefs about consciousness because after all our experience is generally strongly conditioned by our past experience language acculturation personal history and so on but as you continue to release and relax while maintaining the clarity then you're you're not thinking back into but the locus of your awareness the word is Papa descends from it's an ordinary field which is all cut up in dualistic thinking and so forth radical deepened demarcation between subject and object it's slipping deeper and deeper into this dimension of consciousness</p>
<p>that is all that's left when you fall</p>
<p>down when you fall deep asleep</p>
<p>all that's left when you've gone brain</p>
<p>dead underway to dying you're almost</p>
<p>dead in fact this is the point at which</p>
<p>you know the Buddhist doctor said now</p>
<p>you're dead when your mind is</p>
<p>irretrievably we dissolve back into the</p>
<p>substrate consciousness so you're not</p>
<p>observing substrate consciousness from</p>
<p>the mind substrate consciousness</p>
<p>experiencing itself that's non</p>
<p>conceptual not absolutely but that</p>
<p>resting in the substrate consciousness</p>
<p>is unconditioned by gender ethnicity</p>
<p>language personal history and</p>
<p>unconditioned by the brain that's the</p>
<p>high pot and it's a testable hypothesis</p>
<p>that's what makes me so joyful about it</p>
<p>this one we can actually get some</p>
<p>knowledge and not just be bickering back</p>
<p>and forth religion versus science</p>
<p>religious dogma versus scientific dogma</p>
<p>let's break out of that that's what the</p>
<p>Dalai Lama was getting at you know and</p>
<p>so it's still schemata when you're</p>
<p>resting in the substrate consciousness</p>
<p>and the type of mindfulness there when</p>
<p>you've achieved schemata Boojum limba</p>
<p>says this is self-illuminating</p>
<p>mindfulness where the substrate</p>
<p>consciousness is illuminating itself or</p>
<p>in the territory tradition is called ba</p>
<p>ba so cipta the brightly shining mind</p>
<p>that vivanco which is the ground of</p>
<p>becoming from which all the giovanna or</p>
<p>activities of the mind including the</p>
<p>five physical senses all emerge and into</p>
<p>which they dissolve in deep sleep right</p>
<p>and so that's still shammed but it's</p>
<p>gone very quiet and only subliminally</p>
<p>conceptual at a very very subtle level</p>
<p>and there's a subtle level of grasping</p>
<p>when you achieve Shama it's said to be</p>
<p>characterized by three</p>
<p>and this doesn't matter whether you're</p>
<p>Christian agnostic Buddhist into what</p>
<p>have you this is like it said that every</p>
<p>smoke every snow crystals every</p>
<p>snowflake is completely unique so it</p>
<p>said yeah but if you melt any of them</p>
<p>then one drop of water is like any other</p>
<p>drop of water and so your your mind is</p>
<p>absolutely unique there's nobody that</p>
<p>has your mind in the entire universe I</p>
<p>mean it's an opera very certainty right</p>
<p>nobody has your personal history case</p>
<p>closed</p>
<p>but if you melt and that's determined</p>
<p>term that's often used metaphorically if</p>
<p>you melt your mind down to your</p>
<p>substrate conscious from which your mind</p>
<p>arose and which your mind will dissolve</p>
<p>when you die then that's like a drop of</p>
<p>water that is your direct experience of</p>
<p>it now it is conditioned by karma past</p>
<p>memories and so forth and so on but when</p>
<p>you're just resting in hitch in the</p>
<p>Bhuvana or the substrate consciousness</p>
<p>upon achieving schemata they're just</p>
<p>wreak wallah teas they sell me dopa its</p>
<p>blissful luminous and non conceptual</p>
<p>that doesn't matter who you are what</p>
<p>your belief system is whether you're</p>
<p>human or non-human these are the</p>
<p>qualities when you clearly illuminate</p>
<p>this underlying continuum of</p>
<p>consciousness from within itself and</p>
<p>it's beyond brain beyond conditioning of</p>
<p>this life versus that but it's the</p>
<p>ground of becoming so when you take your</p>
<p>next birth your next maybe will be a</p>
<p>woman or a man who knows what next time</p>
<p>your mind then will emerge from that</p>
<p>continuum beyond that though that's</p>
<p>where the pristine awareness is you cut</p>
<p>through that then you're into what's</p>
<p>called the fourth time because Rick but</p>
<p>is not located in the past or the future</p>
<p>and not even located within this this</p>
<p>narrow sliver of the present moment it's</p>
<p>in the fourth time beyond time it's</p>
<p>beyond it's a temporal and non-local but</p>
<p>I've wanted to clarify with you how does</p>
<p>intention fit into that intention</p>
<p>because I associate intention with</p>
<p>action from being</p>
<p>just see well very important term</p>
<p>there's a very closer related term which</p>
<p>is highlighted enormous degree in my</p>
<p>under tradition Tibetan Vajrayana and so</p>
<p>chen is motivation motivation motivation</p>
<p>intention very close right and so it's</p>
<p>very true in our extra spectrum</p>
<p>outward-looking modern society you've</p>
<p>ever heard the phrase don't just sit</p>
<p>there do something stupid never heard</p>
<p>that one before</p>
<p>so we are your eccentric civilization</p>
<p>for at least the past 400 years there's</p>
<p>been a civilization with the Protestant</p>
<p>ethic with our conquering of North South</p>
<p>America most of the rest of the globe</p>
<p>you know through imperialism colonialism</p>
<p>and so forth with the rise of the sign</p>
<p>of revolution and the project</p>
<p>Reformation I mean all these forces</p>
<p>converging in on one thing be productive</p>
<p>conquer at least but do something you</p>
<p>know and therefore invention is always</p>
<p>linked to doing something but of course</p>
<p>if you become inspired by the teachings</p>
<p>and practices absorption will you do it</p>
<p>or not it's your it's your choice which</p>
<p>means it's your intention but then when</p>
<p>it comes to Vaudrey on in particular and</p>
<p>so chen more specifically it is said</p>
<p>actually there's only one authentic or</p>
<p>suitable fit in terms of motivation it's</p>
<p>got to be bodhichitta if one practices</p>
<p>VAD Rihanna or zou Chen with it with a</p>
<p>self centered motivation but I want</p>
<p>something for me I'm out for myself I</p>
<p>just want to achieve something myself</p>
<p>that's your choice but you can't</p>
<p>practice option it's a it's a total</p>
<p>mismatch it's a total mismatch it said</p>
<p>in judgment lien linguist writings in</p>
<p>the virtual essence that relative</p>
<p>bodhichitta</p>
<p>you know the turn well it the aspiration</p>
<p>achieved a microp the physic of all</p>
<p>sentient beings about a thought for</p>
<p>ideal emerges from spontaneously emerges</p>
<p>from Ripa and that's intention so</p>
<p>intention motivation as just part of</p>
<p>mental health you know we can speak very</p>
<p>deeply about soake shin but I think it's</p>
<p>good to come back to where we just live</p>
<p>our day-to-day lives whether in Boston</p>
<p>or anywhere else how relevant is the are</p>
<p>these teachings which</p>
<p>quite esoteric in any way relevant are</p>
<p>they for us in our day-to-day lives</p>
<p>doing grocery shopping balancing our</p>
<p>checkbooks hopefully and just doing the</p>
<p>stuff that we need to do throughout the</p>
<p>course of the day and I would suggest</p>
<p>that we living in modernity</p>
<p>it's especially the 20th century but it</p>
<p>goes back to the 17th century Blaise</p>
<p>Pascal the great map the French</p>
<p>mathematician and philosopher he said</p>
<p>and I paraphrase very concisely he said</p>
<p>the trouble the problem with modern man</p>
<p>is our ability inability to say quietly</p>
<p>in our chambers even then we were</p>
<p>addicted to and I think it is a literal</p>
<p>addiction addicted to stimulation</p>
<p>addicted to doing addicted keeping busy</p>
<p>even if it's keeping busy with something</p>
<p>that is absolutely devoid of any meaning</p>
<p>whatsoever better that then just be</p>
<p>quiet and be still but you know this is</p>
<p>wisdom of the ages and it's east and</p>
<p>west be still and know thyself</p>
<p>be still and know thyself deeper and</p>
<p>deeper and deeper but you won't do that</p>
<p>unless you have intention Ellen on this</p>
<p>note Galecki I'm going to take a little</p>
<p>trip off the left-field Greek antiquity</p>
<p>Socrates Plato Aristotle these powerful</p>
<p>thinkers they're still influencing us to</p>
<p>this day that's pretty formidable they</p>
<p>do a very short and clear distinction</p>
<p>between cadonia and this is over the</p>
<p>pleasure we get from the world from</p>
<p>family friends sensual enjoyments</p>
<p>activity successes prestige wealth power</p>
<p>and so forth cadonia</p>
<p>good bad neutral is everything but it's</p>
<p>Adonia and it comes and goes and you die</p>
<p>it just goes right everything you've</p>
<p>acquired is lost and then there is what</p>
<p>the Greek call eudaimonia genuine</p>
<p>well-being and if you don't is the joy</p>
<p>we get from the world eudaimonia is the</p>
<p>well-being that we bring to the world</p>
<p>it's by our way of life by the quality</p>
<p>of mind we bring to the world by the</p>
<p>quality of insight of wisdom we bring to</p>
<p>the world and that can carry us through</p>
<p>all the vicissitudes of life and death</p>
<p>right but in order to prioritize to</p>
<p>place of great value not on the pursuit</p>
<p>of eudaimonia but the cultivation of</p>
<p>eudaimonia for that we must spend time</p>
<p>in stillness as I was forced to when I</p>
<p>was 24 years old I was told I had to sit</p>
<p>through ten days of goenka's retreat</p>
<p>when he gave very little teaching and</p>
<p>had a sit for 11 hours a day and it was</p>
<p>just miserable seeing what a mess my</p>
<p>mind was and I thought if this is what</p>
<p>I'm bringing to the world</p>
<p>maybe I should clean up my own act</p>
<p>before I have any pretence of being a</p>
<p>Buddhist scholar or anything else you</p>
<p>know and so that time of stillness it's</p>
<p>a time for searing honesty and as we</p>
<p>have this term genuine happiness from</p>
<p>the Greeks I coined a term genuine</p>
<p>unhappiness and as he donate is always</p>
<p>stimulus driven it's a response to</p>
<p>something pleasant</p>
<p>there's stimulus driven unhappiness</p>
<p>that's also a response to something</p>
<p>unpleasant something happens that I</p>
<p>didn't want or something doesn't happen</p>
<p>that they did want and then I'm a happy</p>
<p>that's pretty simple but what about when</p>
<p>you're sitting quietly in your chambers</p>
<p>as Blaise Pascal suggested and there's</p>
<p>nothing good or bad happening to you</p>
<p>you're living just sitting in a room</p>
<p>quietly and what if while you're sitting</p>
<p>there quietly in good health welfare not</p>
<p>thirsty not cold not too hard just</p>
<p>sitting there if in that simplicity in</p>
<p>that solitude of just being yourself in</p>
<p>the universe if you experienced dukkha a</p>
<p>sense of uneasiness of dissatisfaction a</p>
<p>boredom of restlessness of agitation of</p>
<p>malaise</p>
<p>that's genuine unhappiness because</p>
<p>that's what you're bringing to the world</p>
<p>not what you're getting from it and so</p>
<p>if our ground state is one where you're</p>
<p>sitting quietly with nothing coming in</p>
<p>Pleasant or unpleasant from the</p>
<p>environment and not even thinking happy</p>
<p>thoughts or having unhappy thoughts just</p>
<p>being present and if you so cultivate</p>
<p>the balance of</p>
<p>mind then a sense of well-being Springs</p>
<p>right from the very nature of your mind</p>
<p>itself it's a symptom of a wonderfully</p>
<p>balanced mind a symptom of a healthy</p>
<p>mind whereas a mind that is chronically</p>
<p>and eventually prone to rumination</p>
<p>craving hostility agitation restlessness</p>
<p>egotism boredom and so forth these are</p>
<p>all symptoms the dukkha of that is a</p>
<p>symptom of a mind it's fundamentally</p>
<p>unhealthy and how we deal with that in</p>
<p>modernity I am very sad to say is lose</p>
<p>ourselves in work lose ourselves after</p>
<p>work in entertainment and then lose</p>
<p>ourselves in drugs alcohol nicotine</p>
<p>legal drugs illegal drugs and if</p>
<p>anything seriously wrong with your mind</p>
<p>well after all it's probably a brain</p>
<p>disorder to take a drug just say yes</p>
<p>and that's what we're telling our</p>
<p>teenagers if they have depression which</p>
<p>is on the rise gonna ten times since the</p>
<p>rise of modern neuroscience which is</p>
<p>supposed to solve our problem mentally</p>
<p>because they're actually brain disorders</p>
<p>the president's gone up ten times over</p>
<p>the last 50 60 years and general anxiety</p>
<p>disorder disheartened insomnia</p>
<p>posttraumatic stress disorder ADHD and</p>
<p>what's our primary intervention there</p>
<p>are many very good therapists and</p>
<p>psychiatrists but over all drugs tend to</p>
<p>be the first resort and the drugs are</p>
<p>shoot the messenger because these are</p>
<p>symptoms of a mind that is not balanced</p>
<p>and instead of balancing the mind we</p>
<p>smother the symptoms so in very</p>
<p>important ways I think we're living in a</p>
<p>dark age right now a Dark Age about the</p>
<p>nature and the potentials of the mind</p>
<p>the source of eudaimonia the sources of</p>
<p>true suffering and we're smothering it</p>
<p>with work entertainment and drugs that's</p>
<p>not a sign of enlightened era it's a</p>
<p>sign of an era Dark Age and there's a</p>
<p>great contemporary tradition this not a</p>
<p>sectarian segment the great contemporary</p>
<p>conditions the Sufi the Christian the</p>
<p>Buddhist Muslim Taoist and so forth have</p>
<p>just a treasure troves of wisdom that we</p>
<p>can be drawing on but maybe a nice</p>
<p>strong hunch is these content these</p>
<p>the traditions each wonderful great in</p>
<p>its own right I think they need a kick</p>
<p>in the behind from science because</p>
<p>religions tend to be complacent</p>
<p>self-satisfied dogmatic closed-minded</p>
<p>and rigid you know but that's what</p>
<p>that's what that's what people do how do</p>
<p>the Easter what scientists do that -</p>
<p>they fall under the trench of scientific</p>
<p>toriel ISM and they don't need an even</p>
<p>though they fallen into it they just</p>
<p>think they're being scientific science</p>
<p>needs to be rescued by the</p>
<p>contemplatives and the great contempt uh</p>
<p>traditions need to be rescued by science</p>
<p>and then we'll see a great union of</p>
<p>meaning and truth to the benefit of all</p>
<p>without exception so I hope you enjoyed</p>
<p>the conversation with Alan Wallace next</p>
<p>week we are joined by scholar of Tibetan</p>
<p>Buddhism guy Newland who gives us a</p>
<p>heartfelt account of the grief journey</p>
<p>that he experienced when his wife</p>
<p>Valerie passed away I hope you join us</p>
<p>for this episode it's so touching and</p>
<p>filled with so much wisdom something</p>
<p>that is a basis of connection I mean</p>
<p>when I talk about in the book this one</p>
<p>little situation when I would take</p>
<p>Valerie to get chemotherapy and we go to</p>
<p>this place at the University of Michigan</p>
<p>work everyone was getting chemotherapy</p>
<p>and it was like there was some kind of</p>
<p>like what do you say not sure there's</p>
<p>something peaceful about being in a</p>
<p>place where no one's pretending that</p>
<p>everything is okay right and this is I</p>
<p>think one of the difficulties when</p>
<p>people are in the midst of grief or loss</p>
<p>is that there's sort of this pressure to</p>
<p>maintain the pretense that somehow</p>
<p>basically everything is okay</p>
<p>so I think almost everybody has when</p>
<p>they when they lose somebody important a</p>
<p>sense of how hot is it go out the next</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>very</p>
