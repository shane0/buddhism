He argues that we often have a tendency to constantly strive for something, whether it be material possessions or a certain state of mind. This striving can lead to stress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction.</p> <p>In his teachings, Thich Nhat Hanh encourages individuals to cultivate a state of aimlessness, where they can let go of their desires and just be in the present moment. He explains that when we let go of our goals and desires, we can experience true peace and happiness. In this state of aimlessness, we can simply be present and enjoy each moment as it unfolds, without being attached to outcomes or results.</p> <p>In his book, \"The Sun My Heart,\" Thich Nhat Hanh writes: \"The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence.

Shunyata, also known as emptiness, is the Buddhist concept that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence. This means that all phenomena are impermanent, interconnected, and interdependent. They arise and disappear in dependence on other phenomena, and they have no independent or unchanging reality</p> <p>Anapanasati, also known as mindfulness of breathing, is a powerful meditation practice that can help you to realize shunyata. By paying close attention to the breath, you can learn to see the impermanence and interconnectedness of all phenomena. You can also learn to let go of attachment to the breath and to all other phenomena</p> <p>Here are some specific ways that you can use anapanasati to realize shunyata:</p> <ul> <li>Observe the impermanence of the breath. Notice how the breath is constantly changing. It is never the same from one moment to the next. This is a reminder that all phenomena are impermanent, including the self</li> <li>Observe the interconnectedness of the breath. The breath is not an isolated phenomenon. It is interconnected with everything else in the body and mind. It is also interconnected with the environment. This is a reminder that all phenomena are interconnected and interdependent</li> <li>Let go of attachment to the breath. Don't try to control the breath or to change it in any way. Simply observe it as it is. This is a training in letting go of attachment to all phenomena</li> <li>As you continue to practice anapanasati, you will begin to develop a deeper understanding of shunyata. You will see that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, and you will learn to let go of attachment to all things</li> </ul> <p>Here are some additional tips for your practice:</p> <ul> <li>Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed</li> <li>Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight</li> <li>Close your eyes and bring your attention to the breath</li> <li>Notice the sensation of the breath entering and leaving your body</li> <li>Don't try to control the breath or to change it in any way</li> <li>Simply observe the breath as it is</li> <li>If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath</li> <li>Start with short meditation sessions and gradually increase the duration of your practice</li> <li>With regular practice, you will begin to experience the benefits of anapanasati and to develop a deeper understanding of shunyata</li> </ul>","tags":["sit","breath","daily","support"]},{"location":"awakening/","title":"7 Factors for awakening","text":"<ol> <li>mindfulness</li> <li>investigation of phenomena</li> <li>diligence</li> <li>joy</li> <li>ease</li> <li>concentration</li> <li> <p>letting go</p> </li> <li> <p>Himavanta Sutta \u00a0(SN\u00a046:1)</p> </li> <li>https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN46_1.html</li> <li>https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN45_8.html</li> </ol>"},{"location":"awareness/","title":"awareness","text":"<ul> <li>enlightenment</li> <li>pure</li> <li>right mindfulness</li> <li>reflection</li> <li>observation</li> <li>consciousness</li> </ul> <p>Pure and intrinsic awareness (jue-xing)</p> <ul> <li>That which knows and perceives, also known as the buddha nature inherent in all sentient beings.</li> </ul> <p>Awareness of observation (jue-cha)</p> <ul> <li>The mind attentively observes itself and notices the thoughts and afflictions that arise within.</li> </ul> <p>Awareness of reflection (jue-zhao)</p> <ul> <li>The mind clearly observes its own thoughts and counteracts the unwholesome ones by turning them into wholesome ones.</li> </ul> <p>Right mindfulness (zheng-nian)</p> <ul> <li>The state in which the mind is attending only to wholesome thoughts without attachments, a mind free of distraction and delusion, and ultimately free of thought, also known as no-thought.</li> </ul> <p>Consciousness (vi-sh)</p> <ul> <li>The thinking mind that gives rise to conceptualization, deluded thoughts, and dream states.</li> </ul> <p>Enlightenment or awakening (jue-wu)</p> <ul> <li>It is the mind that is awakened to its true nature.

Sheltered from the harsh realities of the world, he lived a life of luxury and indulgence. Yet, within his heart, a flicker of discontent stirred.</p> <p>As he ventured beyond the confines of his sheltered existence, he witnessed the inescapable truth of suffering. The sight of the sick, the aged, and the grieving pierced his veil of privilege, awakening a profound yearning for liberation from the cycle of pain.</p> <p>Driven by an unyielding resolve to find a path to enlightenment, Prince Siddhartha made a momentous decision. He would renounce his worldly possessions and embark on a spiritual quest to unravel the mysteries of suffering and its cessation.</p> <p>Stage 2: Leaving the Home Life</p> <p>Under the cover of darkness, Prince Siddhartha bid farewell to his wife, Yashodhara, and his newborn son, Rahula. With unwavering determination, he mounted his faithful steed, Kanthaka, and rode into the unknown.</p> <p>As he ventured into the wilderness, he shed the trappings of his royal lineage, exchanging his princely garments for the simple robes of a seeker. With unwavering resolve, he embarked on a journey that would forever alter the course of human history.</p> <p>Stage 3: Practicing Austerities</p> <p>Driven by an insatiable thirst for enlightenment, Prince Siddhartha sought guidance from renowned spiritual teachers. He subjected himself to rigorous austerities, pushing the limits of human endurance in his quest for liberation.</p> <p>For six years, he endured extreme hardship, depriving himself of food and sleep in a relentless pursuit of spiritual awakening. Yet, despite his unwavering dedication, the path to enlightenment remained elusive.</p> <p>Stage 4: Attaining Enlightenment</p> <p>Weary of extreme asceticism, Prince Siddhartha realized that the path to enlightenment lay not in self-mortification but in moderation and balance. Seated beneath the bodhi tree, he vowed to remain unmoving until he had attained the ultimate truth.</p> <p>As the night wore on, Prince Siddhartha delved into the depths of his being, confronting the illusions and attachments that clouded his mind.

His return was a beacon of hope for all those seeking to awaken from the slumber of ignorance.</p> <p>Stage 7: Manifesting Various Emanations</p> <p>In order to cater to the diverse needs and dispositions of all beings, the Buddha manifested various emanations.

Prajna is one of the six perfections (paramitas) in Mahayana Buddhism, and is considered essential for achieving enlightenment. Four Types of Prajna Shravaka Prajna Refers to the wisdom or understanding attained by Hinayana practitioners, who seek to attain individual liberation (nirvana) through the realization of the Four Noble Truths. Pratyekabuddha Prajna Refers to the wisdom or understanding attained by solitary practitioners who seek to attain enlightenment for themselves alone, without the help of a teacher or community. Bodhisattva Prajna Refers to the wisdom or understanding attained by Mahayana practitioners, who seek to attain enlightenment not only for themselves but for the benefit of all sentient beings. Tathagata Prajna Refers to the highest form of wisdom or understanding, attained by fully enlightened Buddhas, who have realized the ultimate nature of reality and have the ability to teach others to do the same. Three Characteristics of Existence Description Anicca Refers to the idea that all things are constantly changing and in a state of flux. Nothing in the world is permanent, and everything is subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death. Dukkha Refers to the idea that all things in the world are inherently unsatisfactory and cannot provide lasting happiness or fulfillment. This suffering is caused by our attachment to impermanent things and our ignorance of the true nature of reality. Anatta Refers to the idea that there is no fixed or permanent self or soul. Rather, our sense of self is an ever-changing product of our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The concept of anatta is closely related to the idea of emptiness (shunyata), which is the ultimate nature of all phenomena according to Mahayana Buddhism.

For this reason, it has caused much misunderstanding for almost 2,000 years.</p> <p>Tay would like to share with you two stories: the story of a novice monk that paid a visit to a Zen master, and the story of a Bhikkhu who came with a question to the Eminent Master Tue Trung.</p> <p>In the first story, the Zen master asked the novice monk:</p> <p>Tell me about your understanding of the Heart sutra.</p> <p>The novice monk joined his palms and replied:</p> <p>I have understood that the fve skandhas are empty. Tere are no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body or mind; there are no forms, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings, or objects of mind; the six consciousnesses do not exist, the eighteen realms of phenomena do not exist, the twelve links of dependent arising do not exist, and even wisdom and attainment do not exist.</p> <p>Do you believe what it says?</p> <p>Yes, I truly believe what it says.</p> <p>Come closer to me,  the Zen master instructed the novice monk. When the novice monk drew near, the Zen master immediately used his thumb and index finger to pinch and twist the novice's nose.</p> <p>In great agony, the novice cried out  Teacher! You're hurting me!  The Zen master looked at the novice.  Just now you said that the nose doesn't exist. But if the nose doesn't exist then what's hurting?</p> <p>Te Eminent Master Tue Trung was a lay Zen master who had once served as the mentor for the young King Tran Nhan Tong, in 13th Century Vietnam. One day, a Bhikkhu paid him a visit to ask him about the Heart Sutra.</p> <p>Respected Eminent Master, what does the phrase 'form is emptiness, emptiness is form,' really mean?</p> <p>At frst the Eminent Master remained silent. And then, after a while, he asked:  Bhikkhu, do you have a body?</p> <p>Yes, I do.</p> <p>Ten, why do you say that the body does not exist?</p> <p>The Eminent Master then continued,  Do you think that in empty space there is form?</p> <p>No, I do not see that there is form.</p> <p>Ten why do you say that emptiness is form?</p> <p>The Bhikkhu stood up, bowed, and went on his way. But the Master summoned him back in order to recite to him the following gatha:</p> <p>Form is emptiness, emptiness is form, is a skillful means created temporarily by the Buddhas of the three times. Emptiness is not form, form is not emptiness -</p> <p>Their nature is always pure and illuminating, neither caught in being nor in non-being. In this story the Eminent Master Tue Trung seems to contradict the Heart Sutra and challenge the sacred formula 'form is emptiness and emptiness is form,' considered inviolable in the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature.</p> <p>Thay believes that the Eminent Master went too far. Te Master was not able to see that the mistake doesn't rest in the formula, 'form is emptiness' rather, it resides in the unskillfulness of the line, 'Terefore in emptiness there is no form.' According to Tay, the way in which words are used in the Heart Sutra, right from the beginning up to the line: 'no birth, no death, not defled, not immaculate, not increasing, nor decreasing,' is already perfect. Tay\u2019s only regret is that the patriarch who recorded the Heart Sutra did not add the four words 'no being, no non-being' immediately after the four words 'no birth, no death,' because these four words would help us transcend the notion of being and non-being, and we would no longer get caught in such ideas as 'no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue\u2026' Te nose of the novice monk is still sore, even today. Do you understand?</p> <p>The problem begins with the line: 'Listen Shariputra, because in emptiness, there is no form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness' (in Sanskrit: Tasm\u0101c\u015a\u0101riputra\u015b\u016bnyatay\u0101mnar\u016bpamnavedan\u0101nasamj\u00f1\u0101nasamsk\u0101r\u0101navij\u00f1\u0101nam).</p> <p>How funny!</p> <p>It was previously stated that emptiness is form, and form is emptiness, but now you say the opposite: there is only emptiness, there is no body.</p> <p>This line of the sutra can lead to many damaging misunderstandings. It removes all phenomena from the category 'being' and places them into the category of 'non-being' (no form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations or consciousness...).</p> <p>Yet the true nature of all phenomena is the nature of no being nor non-being, no birth and no death.</p> <p>The view of 'being' is one extreme view and the view of 'non-being' is another extreme view. It is because of this unskilfulness that the novice monk's nose is still sore. Te famous gatha ascribed to the sixth patriarch Hue Nang (Hui-neng), in which he presented his insight to the ffth patriarch Hoang Nhan (Hung-jen), also expresses this notion and is also caught in the same wrong view:</p> <p>Originally, there is no Bodhi tree</p> <p>Te bright mirror does not exist either</p> <p>From the non-beginning of time nothing has ever existed</p> <p>So where can the dust settle?</p> <p>A white cloud passes by and hides the mouth of the cave</p> <p>Causing so many birds to lose their way home.</p> <p>The insight of praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 is the most liberating insight that helps us overcome all pairs of opposites such as birth and death, being and non-being, deflement and immaculacy, increasing and decreasing, subject and object, and so on, and helps us to get in touch with the true nature of no birth/no death, no being/no non-being etc\u2026 which is the true nature of all phenomena.</p> <p>This is a state of coolness, peace, and non-fear that can be experienced in this very life, in your own body and in your own fve skandhas.</p> <p>It is nirvana. Just as the birds enjoy the sky, and the deer enjoy the meadow, so do the wise enjoy dwelling in nirvana.</p> <p>This is a very beautiful sentence in the Nirvana Chapter of the Chinese Dharmapada.</p> <p>The insight of praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 is the ultimate truth, transcending of all conventional truths. It is the highest vision of the Buddha.</p> <p>Whatever paragraph in the Tripitaka, even in the most impressive of the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 collections, if it so contradicts this, it is still caught in conventional truth.</p> <p>Unfortunately, in the Heart Sutra we fnd such a paragraph, and it is quite long.</p> <p>That is why in this new translation Tay has changed the way of using words in both the original Sanskrit and the Chinese translation by Huyen Trang (Xuan-Zang).</p> <p>Thay translates as follows: 'Tat is why in emptiness, body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness are not separate self entities.' All phenomena are products of dependent arising: that is the main point of the praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 teaching.</p> <p>'Even insight and attainment do not exist as separate self entities.'</p> <p>This sentence is as important as the sentence 'form is emptiness.' Tay also has added 'no being, no non-being' into the text.</p> <p>No being, no non-being is the deep vision of the Buddha stated in the K\u0101ty\u0101yana sutra, when he offered a defnition on right view. These four words, no being, no non-being, will help future generations not to suffer from a twisted nose.</p> <p>The Heart Sutra was intended to help the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins relinquish the view of no self and no dharma.</p> <p>The deepest teaching of Pr\u0101j\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 is the emptiness of self (\u0101tma\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) and the emptiness of dharma (dharmanair\u0101tmya) and not the non-being of self and dharma.</p> <p>Te Buddha has taught in the K\u0101ty\u0101yana sutra that most people in the world are caught either in the view of being and non-being.</p> <p>Therefore, the sentence 'in emptiness there is no form, feelings...' is obviously still caught in the view of non-being.</p> <p>That is why this sentence does not correspond to the Ultimate Truth. Emptiness of self only means the emptiness of self, not the non-being of self, just as a balloon that is empty inside does not mean that the balloon does not exist.</p> <p>The same is true with the emptiness of dharma: it only means the emptiness of all phenomena and not the non-existence of phenomena.</p> <p>It is like a flower that is made only of non-fower elements. Te fower is empty of a separate existence, but that doesn't mean that the fower is not there.</p> <p>Th Heart Sutra made a late appearance at a time when Tantric Buddhism had begun to flourish.</p> <p>The patriarch who compiled the Heart Sutra wanted to encourage followers of Tantric Buddhism to practice and recite the Heart Sutra, so that's why he presented the Heart Sutra as a kind of mantra.</p> <p>This was also a skillful means.</p> <p>Tay has used the phrase, 'The Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore,' because in the mantra there is the expression p\u0101raga Th which means 'gone over to the other shore, the shore of wisdom'.</p> <p>P\u0101r\u0101yana and p\u0101ramit\u0101 have both been translated as 'crossing over to the other shore.'</p> <p>In the Sutta Nip\u0101ta there is a chapter called P\u0101r\u0101yana which has also been translated as 'crossing over to the other shore.'</p> <p>Dear Family, I hope you enjoy practicing the new version of the Heart Sutra in English.</p> <p>We have an English translation and Br.

The skandhas are the five components of our personality: form, perception, feeling, thinking, and consciousness.</p> <p>When we realize that the skandhas are empty, we see that they are not permanent or substantial. They are constantly changing and interdependent. This realization leads to the transcendence of all suffering.</p> <p>The Heart Sutra then goes on to explain that all phenomena are empty, including form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and phenomena. This does not mean that these things do not exist. It simply means that they are not inherent or fixed. They are empty of self-nature.</p> <p>When we understand the emptiness of all phenomena, we are free from attachment and aversion. We are also free from the fear of death and rebirth.</p> <p>The Heart Sutra concludes by stating that the Bodhisattva dwells in the Perfection of Wisdom, without hindrance and without fear. The Bodhisattva has completely severed delusion and realizes Nirvana.</p> <p>The Heart Sutra is a powerful teaching that can help us to understand the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.

Here's an overview of the differences between Linji and Caodong Zen:</p> <p>Linji (Rinzai) Zen:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Emphasis on Koan Practice: Linji Zen is known for its emphasis on koan practice. Koans are paradoxical questions or statements given to students by Zen masters to provoke deep insights and break through conceptual thinking. Famous koans like \"What is the sound of one hand clapping?\" are associated with Rinzai Zen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intensive Meditation: Rinzai Zen places a strong emphasis on zazen (meditation), but it often incorporates intense and dynamic methods to shock students into a direct experience of reality. Shouting, striking, or other unconventional techniques may be used to push students beyond their usual conceptual thinking.</p> </li> <li> <p>Short and Direct Teachings: Linji Zen teachings are known for their direct and confrontational style. The lineage traces back to the Chinese Zen master Linji Yixuan (Japanese: Rinzai Gigen), who emphasized abrupt and unorthodox teaching methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kensho Experience: Rinzai Zen seeks to provoke the kensho experience, which is a sudden and direct realization of one's true nature or Buddha nature.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Caodong (Soto) Zen:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Emphasis on Silent Meditation: Caodong Zen, also known as Soto Zen in Japan, places a strong emphasis on silent seated meditation (zazen). The meditation is typically characterized by long periods of sitting in a still and calm manner.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shikantaza: The primary meditation practice in Soto Zen is called shikantaza, which means \"just sitting.\" It involves sitting without any particular focus or goal, allowing thoughts and experiences to arise and pass away naturally without interference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gentle Approach: Soto Zen generally takes a more gentle and gradual approach to enlightenment, emphasizing the everyday practice of meditation and mindfulness as a means to awaken gradually over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ordinary Mind is the Way: Soto Zen teachings often emphasize that ordinary, everyday activities and experiences are themselves expressions of enlightenment, and there's no need to seek something beyond the ordinary.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, Linji (Rinzai) Zen is known for its intense koan practice, direct teaching style, and emphasis on the sudden kensho experience, while Caodong (Soto) Zen focuses on silent meditation, shikantaza, a more gentle approach to enlightenment, and the idea that ordinary life is itself the way to realization.

They teach that life is suffering, that the cause of suffering is attachment, that there is a way to end suffering, and that the way to end suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path.</li> <li>The Noble Eightfold Path: The Noble Eightfold Path is the Buddhist path to enlightenment. It consists of eight factors: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</li> <li>The Three Jewels: The Three Jewels are the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. They are the three objects of refuge for Buddhists.</li> <li>The Three Pure Precepts: The Three Pure Precepts are refraining from harming others, refraining from taking what is not freely given, and refraining from sexual misconduct.</li> <li>The Five Precepts: The Five Precepts are an extension of the Three Pure Precepts, and they include refraining from lying and refraining from using intoxicants.</li> <li>Dependent Origination: Dependent Origination is the Buddhist teaching that all phenomena are interconnected and interdependent. Nothing exists in isolation, and everything is conditioned by everything else.</li> <li>Emptiness: Emptiness is the Buddhist teaching that all phenomena are lacking in inherent existence.

Don't judge or analyze the thought, feeling, or sensation. Just label it and let it go.</li> <li>Be consistent. Use the same labels for the same things each time. This will help you to track your progress and identify any patterns in your thoughts and feelings.</li> </ul> <p>Labeling what arises is a simple but effective way to cultivate mindfulness and awareness. By practicing this technique, you can learn to observe your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment.

Ignorance (avijja) Not understanding the true nature of reality, including the emptiness of inherent existence. Cultivate wisdom and understanding of the true nature of reality. 2. Volitional formations (samskara) Based on our ignorance, we create volitional formations, such as desires and aversions. Practice mindfulness and meditation to cultivate awareness of our volitional formations and to let go of them. 3. Consciousness (vijnana) Our consciousness is conditioned by our volitional formations. Cultivate pure awareness that is not conditioned by our volitional formations. 4. Name-and-form (nama-rupa) Our name-and-form, which is the physical and mental aggregate that we identify as ourselves, is conditioned by our consciousness. Practice mindfulness of the body and mind to see through the illusion of a permanent self. 5. The six sense bases (salayatana) The six sense bases, which are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, are conditioned by our name-and-form. Practice mindfulness of the six sense bases to develop awareness of how they contact the external world and create sensations. 6. Contact (phassa) Contact between the six sense bases and their objects arises. Develop non-attachment to the objects of contact. 7. Feeling (vedana) Feelings arise from contact. Develop equanimity towards all feelings, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. 8. Craving (tanha) Craving arises from feelings. Cultivate contentment and let go of craving for things that are impermanent and unsatisfactory. 9. Attachment (upadana) We become attached to the objects of our craving. Practice mindfulness of attachment to identify and let go of our attachments. 10. Becoming (bhava) Becoming, or karma, arises from our attachment. Cultivate wholesome actions and let go of unwholesome actions. 11. Birth (jati) We are reborn into a new life based on our karma. Cultivate wisdom and compassion to break the cycle of rebirth. 12. Old age and death (jaramarana) Old age and death arise from birth. Accept the reality of old age and death and live each day to the fullest. <p>It is important to note that the twelve links are not a linear sequence of events. Instead, they are a dynamic web of causes and conditions that give rise to suffering.

The twelve links are:</p> <ol> <li>Ignorance: Not knowing the true nature of reality.</li> <li>Voilitional formations: Mental and physical actions that we create in response to our ignorance.</li> <li>Consciousness: The ability to be aware of our thoughts, feelings, and sensations.</li> <li>Name and form: The physical and mental embodiment of our consciousness.</li> <li>The six sense bases: The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.</li> <li>Contact: The interaction between our sense bases and the external world.</li> <li>Feeling: Our subjective experience of contact.</li> <li>Craving: Our desire for the things that we perceive as pleasant and our aversion to the things that we perceive as unpleasant.</li> <li>Grasping: Our attachment to the things that we crave.</li> <li>Becoming: The process of creating new karma based on our attachments.</li> <li>Birth: The result of our becoming.</li> <li>Old age, death, and sorrow: The inevitable consequences of birth.</li> </ol> <p>The twelve links are interconnected and interdependent. Each link arises from the previous link and gives rise to the next link. For example, ignorance gives rise to volitional formations, volitional formations give rise to consciousness, and so on.</p> <p>The twelve links of dependent origination are not a linear process. Instead, they are a cyclical process, with each link influencing the others. For example, our ignorance about the true nature of reality leads us to create volitional formations that are based on our cravings and attachments. These volitional formations then give rise to consciousness that is also based on our cravings and attachments. This process continues on and on, leading to suffering.</p> <p>The good news is that the twelve links of dependent origination can also be used to end suffering. By understanding the interconnectedness of the twelve links, we can begin to break the cycle of suffering. For example, if we can see that our ignorance is the root of our suffering, we can start to cultivate wisdom and understanding. This will help us to see the world as it really is, rather than how we want it to be. As we cultivate wisdom, our cravings and attachments will naturally begin to diminish. This will lead to a more peaceful and contented state of mind.</p> <p>The twelve links of dependent origination is a complex teaching, but it is one of the most important teachings in Buddhism.

Prajna is one of the six perfections (paramitas) in Mahayana Buddhism, and is considered essential for achieving enlightenment. Four Types of Prajna Shravaka Prajna Refers to the wisdom or understanding attained by Hinayana practitioners, who seek to attain individual liberation (nirvana) through the realization of the Four Noble Truths. Pratyekabuddha Prajna Refers to the wisdom or understanding attained by solitary practitioners who seek to attain enlightenment for themselves alone, without the help of a teacher or community. Bodhisattva Prajna Refers to the wisdom or understanding attained by Mahayana practitioners, who seek to attain enlightenment not only for themselves but for the benefit of all sentient beings. Tathagata Prajna Refers to the highest form of wisdom or understanding, attained by fully enlightened Buddhas, who have realized the ultimate nature of reality and have the ability to teach others to do the same. Three Characteristics of Existence Description Anicca Refers to the idea that all things are constantly changing and in a state of flux. Nothing in the world is permanent, and everything is subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death. Dukkha Refers to the idea that all things in the world are inherently unsatisfactory and cannot provide lasting happiness or fulfillment. This suffering is caused by our attachment to impermanent things and our ignorance of the true nature of reality. Anatta Refers to the idea that there is no fixed or permanent self or soul. Rather, our sense of self is an ever-changing product of our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The concept of anatta is closely related to the idea of emptiness (shunyata), which is the ultimate nature of all phenomena according to Mahayana Buddhism.

He also presents the concept of \"store consciousness,\" which is the accumulation of all experiences and memories that make up an individual's unique perception of reality.</p> <p>The Practice of Meditation: Hui-neng emphasizes the importance of meditation and MINDFULNESS as the path to awakening and realization of one's true nature. He teaches that through the practice of meditation, one can calm the mind, still the fluctuations of thought, and awaken to the nature of mind.</p> <p>The Path to Enlightenment: Hui-neng presents a path to enlightenment that emphasizes the importance of direct experience and realization, rather than relying on scriptures or doctrine. He teaches that the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is to awaken to one's true nature and to attain enlightenment.</p> <p>The Five Ranks: Hui-neng presents the concept of the Five Ranks, which describe the stages of spiritual development and the realization of one's true nature. The Five Ranks are: (1) the rank of ordinary people, (2) the rank of those who have made a spiritual connection, (3) the rank of enlightenment, (4) the rank of great enlightenment, and (5) the rank of those who have transcended enlightenment.</p> <p>The Mind-Only Doctrine: Hui-neng also discusses the Mind-Only doctrine, which teaches that all phenomena arise from the mind and that ultimate reality is not separate from the mind. This doctrine emphasizes the idea that our perceptions and experiences are constructed by the mind, and that true reality cannot be grasped through the senses or intellect.</p> <p>These are the main themes and topics covered in the Platform Sutra, which is a seminal text in the Zen tradition and continues to be studied and practiced by Zen practitioners today.</p>","tags":["non dual","zen","oxherding"]},{"location":"shunryu/#oxherding-gist","title":"oxherding gist","text":"<ul> <li> <p>this paragraph is using <code>url_download</code> to embed a github gist on this site</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/53660</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>One aimlessly pushes the grasses\naside in search.\nThe rivers are wide,\nthe mountains far away,\nand the path becomes longer.\nExhausted and dispirited,\none hears only the late autumn cicadas\nshrilling in the maple woods.\n\nBy the water, and under the trees,\nthere are numerous traces.\nFragrant grasses grow thickly,\nbut did you see the ox?\nEven in the depths\nof the distant mountain forest,\nHow could the upturned nostrils\nof the ox be concealed?\n\nA bush warbler sings upon a branch,\nwarm sun, soft breezes,\ngreen willows on the bank.\nNowhere can the ox escape to hide,\nbut those majestic horns\nare difficult to draw.\n\nWith all my energy,\nI seize the ox.\nHis will is strong, and his power endless,\nand he cannot be tamed easily.\nSometimes he charges\nto the high plateau.\nAnd there he stays,\ndeep in the mist.\n\nOne does not let go of the whip or the rope,\nafraid it will stray\nand choose the dusty mist.\nA well-tended ox becomes gentle,\nand even with no rope,\nWill follow people\nby himself.\n\nRiding the bull, I leisurely\nwander toward home.\nExotic flute melodies echo\nthrough sunset clouds.\nEach beat and each tune\nis indescribably profound.\nNo words are needed for those\nwho understand music.\n\nRiding on the ox,\nhe has come home.\nThere is no ox there,\nand he is at ease.\nAlthough the sun is high,\nhe is still dreamy.\nThe whip and rope abandoned\nin the thatched hut.\n\nWhip, rope, man, and ox,\nall are non-existent.\nThe blue sky being vast,\nno message can be heard,\nJust as the snowflake cannot last\nin the flaming red furnace.\nAfter this state, one can join\nthe ancient teachers.\n\nIn returning to the fundamentals\nand going back to the source,\nI had to work so hard.\nPerhaps it would be better\nto be blind and deaf.\nBeing in the hut,\nI do not see what is outside.\nThe river flowing tranquilly,\nthe flower simply being red.\n\nHe enters the city barefoot,\nwith chest exposed.\nCovered in dust and ashes,\nsmiling broadly.\nNo need for the magic powers\nof the gods and immortals.\nJust let the dead tree bloom again.\n</code></pre>","tags":["non dual","zen","oxherding"]},{"location":"shunryu/#more-koans","title":"more koans","text":"Koan Person Link What is the sound of one hand clapping?

If you sit in the same place each time, you can keep the notebook there. If you sit in different places wherever or whenever you can, then keep your notebook with you in a bag or backpack. You can write down the thoughts that come to you, the insights you have. You can also draw. Writing when your mind is clear after sitting can be very satisfying. You don\u2019t need to read it right away. Perhaps leave it for a while, so you can continue to reflect without judgment.</p> <p>GIFTS OF THE PRACTICE</p> <p>Sitting and breathing mindfully brings four important elements into our lives: peace, clarity, compassion, and courage. When we are peaceful and clear, we are inspired to be more compassionate. Compassion brings courage, and courage brings true happiness. When you have great compassion in yourself, you have the capacity to act with courage. You have enough courage to look deeply at old habits, acknowledge fear, and make decisions that can cut through craving and anger. If you don\u2019t have enough compassion for yourself and for others, you won\u2019t have the courage to cut off the afflictions that make you suffer.</p> <p>BODY MIND AND BREATH</p> <p>In our daily lives, our attention is dispersed. Our body is in one place, our breath is ignored, and our mind is wandering. As soon as we pay attention to our breath, as we breathe in, these three things\u2014body, breath, and mind\u2014come together. This can happen in just one or two seconds. You come back to yourself. Your awareness brings these three elements together, and you become fully present in the here and the now. You are taking care of your body, you are taking care of your breath, and you are taking care of your mind.</p> <p>When you make a soup, you have to add together all the right ingredients in harmony and let them simmer. Our breath is the broth that brings the different elements together. We bathe spirit and mind in our breath and they become integrated so they are one thing. We are whole.  We don\u2019t need to control our body, mind, and breath. We can just be there for them. We allow them to be themselves.
