thus have i heard

once the bugawan was dwelling near

shravasti

at anatapindika's garden in jeter forest

with the full assembly of 1250 bekus

and a great many fearless bodhisattvas

one day before noon the bugawan put on

his patched robe

and picked up his bowl and entered the

capital shravasti

for offerings

after begging for food in the city and

eating his meal of rice

he returned from his daily round in the

afternoon

put his robe and bowl away washed his

feet

and sat down on the appointed seat

after crossing his legs and adjusting

his body

he turned his awareness to what was

before him

a number of bikus then came up to where

the bugawan was sitting

after touching their heads to his feet

they walked around him to the right

three times

and sat down to one side

on this occasion the venerable cebutti

was also present in the assembly

rising from his seat he uncovered one

shoulder

and touched his right knee to the ground

pressing his palms together and bowing

to the buddha

he said it is rare bugger one

most rare indeed sugata

how the tatargata the arahan

the fully enlightened one blesses

fearless bodhisattvas

with the best of blessings

and it is rare bhagavan how the

tatargata

the arahan the fully enlightened one

entrusts fearless bodhisattvas

with the greatest of trusts

even so bhagavan if a noble son or

daughter should set

forth on the bodhisattva path

how should they stand how should they

walk

and how should they control their

thoughts

the buddha told the venerable cebutti

well said booty well said

so it is cebuti

it is as you say the tatargata blesses

fearless bodhisattvas

with the best of blessings and entrusts

fearless bodhisattvas with the greatest

of trusts

you should therefore truly listen sabuti

and consider this well

i shall tell you how those who set forth

on the bodhisattva path should stand

how they should walk and how they should

control their thoughts

the venerable cebuty answered

may it be so bugawan and gave his full

attention

the buddha said to him

sabuti those who would now set forth on

the bodhisattva path

should thus give birth to this thought

however many beings there are in

whatever realms of being might exist

whether they are born from an egg or

born from a womb

born from the water or born from the air

whether they have form or no form

whether they have perception or no

perception

or neither perception nor no perception

in whatever conceivable realm of being

one might conceive of beings

in the realm of complete nirvana i shall

liberate them all

and though i thus liberate countless

beings

not a single being is liberated

and why not cebuti

a bodhisattva who creates the perception

of a being

cannot be called a bodhisattva

and why not sabuti

no one can be called a bodhisattva who

creates the perception of

a self or who creates the perception of

a being

a life or a soul

moreover cebuty when bodhisattvas give a

gift

they should not be attached to a thing

when they give a gift they should not be

attached to anything at all

they should not be attached to a site

when they give a gift

they should not be attached to a sound a

smell

a taste a touch

or a dharma when they give a gift

thus cebuti fearless bodhisattvas should

give a gift

without being attached to the perception

of an object

and why booty the body of merit of those

bodhisattvas who give a gift

without being attached is not easy to

measure

what do you think cebuti

is the space to the east easy to measure

sabuti replied no

it is not bhagawan

the buddha said likewise

is a space to the south to the west

to the north in between

above below

or in any of the ten directions easy to

measure

sabuti replied

no it is not bhagavan

the buddha said so it is sabuti

the body of merit of those bodhisattvas

who give a gift without being attached

is not easy to measure

thus those who set forth on the

bodhisattva path

should give a gift without being

attached

to the perception of an object

what do you think sabuti can the

tatargata be seen by means of the

possession

of attributes

sabuti replied

no indeed bhagawan the tatargata cannot

be seen by means of the possession of

attributes

and why not bugawan what the tatargata

says

is the possession of attributes is no

possession of attributes

this having been said the buddha told

the venerable cebutti

since the possession of attributes is an

illusion cebuty

and no possession of attributes is no

illusion

by means of attributes that are no

attributes

the tatargata can indeed be seen

this having been said the venerable

savuti asked the buddha

bugger one will there be any beings in

the future

in the final epoch in the final period

in the final 500 years of the dharma

ending age

who give birth to a perception of the

truth of the words of a sutra

such as that spoken here

the buddha said sabuti

do not ask will there be any beings in

the future

in the final epoch in the final period

in the final 500 years of the dharma

ending age

who give birth to a perception of the

truth of the words of the sutra

such as that spoken here

surely cebutti in the future

in the final epoch in the final period

in the final 500 years of the dharma

ending age

[Music]

there will be fearless bodhisattvas

who are capable virtuous

and wise who give birth to a perception

of the truth of the words of a sutra

such as that spoken here

indeed cebuty such fearless bodhisattvas

will have honored not just one buddha

and they will have planted auspicious

roots before

not just one buddha

such fearless bodhisattvas will have

honored

countless hundreds and thousands of

buddhas

and they will have planted auspicious

roots

before countless hundreds and thousands

of buddhas

in the words of a sutra such as that

spoken here

they are sure to gain perfect clarity of

mind

the tatargata knows them sabuti

by means of his buddha knowledge

[Music]

and the tatargata sees them cebuti

by means of his buddha vision

the tatar guitar is aware of them

cebutti

for they all produce and receive a

measureless

infinite body of merit

and how so because cebuti

these fearless bodhisattvas

do not create the perception of a self

nor do they create the perception of a

being

a life or a soul

nor cebuty do these fearless

bodhisattvas create the perception of a

dharma

much less the perception of no dharma

sabuti they do not create a perception

nor no perception

and why not because sabuti

if these fearless bodhisattvas created

the perception of a dharma

they would be attached to a self a being

a life and a soul

likewise if they created the perception

of no dharma

they would be attached to a self a being

a life and a soul

and why not because surely cebutti

fearless bodhisattvas do not cling

to a dharma much less

to no dharma

this is the meaning behind the

tatargata's saying

a dharma teaching is like a raft

if you should let go of dharmas

how much more so no dharmas

once again the buddha asked the

venerable cebutti

what do you think sabuti did the

tatargata realize

any such dharma as unexcelled

perfect enlightenment

and does that a targeted teach any such

dharma

the venerable cebuty thereupon answered

bhagawan as i understand the meaning

of what the buddha says

the tatargata did not realize any such

dharma

as unexcelled perfect enlightenment

nor does the tattagata teach such a

dharma

and why because this dharma

realized and taught by the tatargata

is incomprehensible and

inexpressible and neither a dharma

and why because sages arise

from what is uncreated

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think if some noble son or

daughter

filled the billion worlds of this

universe

with the seven jewels and gave them as a

gift to the tatargatas

the arahants the fully enlightened ones

would the body of merit produced as a

result by this noble son or daughter

be great

cebuti answered great indeed bhagavan

the body of merit produced as a result

by that noble son or daughter

would be great

and how so bhagavan

whatever is said by the tatargata to be

a body of merit

is said by the tatargata to be nobody

thus does the tatagata speak of a body

of merit

as a body of merit

the buddha said sabuti

if instead of filling the billion worlds

of this universe with the seven jewels

and giving them as a gift to the

tatargata

the arahants the fully enlightened ones

this noble son or daughter grasped

but one four-line gather of this dharma

teaching

and made it known and explained it in

detail to others

the body of meri produced as a result

would be immeasurably infinitely greater

and how so cebuti

from this is born the unexcelled perfect

enlightenment of

targeters arahants

and fully enlightened ones

from this are born buddhas and bugger

ones

and how so

buddhadharma's sabuti

buddhadharmas are spoken of by the

tatargata

as no buddhadharmas

thus are they called buddha dharmas

tell me sabuti do those who find the

river

think i have attained the goal of

finding the river

sabuti replied

no indeed bugger one those who find the

river

do not think i have attained the goal of

finding the river

and why not bugger one they do not find

any such

dharma thus are they said

to find the river

they do not find a sight nor do they

find a sound

a smell a taste a touch

thus are they said to find the river

bugger one if those who found the river

should think i have attained the goal

of finding the river they would be

attached to a self

they would be attached to a being a life

and a soul

the buddha said tell me sabuti

to those who return once more think

i have attained the goal of returning

once more

cebuty replied no indeed bugger one

those who return once more do not think

i have attained the goal of returning

once more

and why not bugger one they do not find

any such dharma

as returning once more

thus are they said to return once more

the buddha said tell me sabuti

to those who return no more think

i have attained the goal of returning no

more

sabuti replied no indeed bugawan

those who return no more do not think

i have attained the goal of returning no

more

and why not bugger one

they do not find any such dharma as

returning no more

thus are they said to return

no more

the buddha said tell me sabuti

to those who are free from rebirth think

i have attained freedom from rebirth

sabuti replied no

indeed bugger one those who

are free from rebirth do not think

i have attained freedom from rebirth

and why not bugger one

there is no such dharma as freedom from

rebirth

thus are they said to be free from

rebirth

if bugger one those who are free from

rebirth should think

i have attained freedom from rebirth

they would be attached to a self they

would be attached to a being

a life and a soul

and how so

bhagawan the tatargata the arahant

the fully enlightened one has declared

that i

am foremost among those who dwell free

of passion

bhagawan although i am free from rebirth

and without desires i do not think

i am free from rebirth and without

desires

but go on if i thought i have attained

freedom from rebirth

the tatar guitar would not have singled

me out by saying

foremost among those who dwell free of

passions

is the noble son sabuti

for he dwells nowhere at all

thus is he called one who dwells free of

passion

who dwells free of passion

the buddha said

sabuti what do you think

did the tatargata obtain any such dharma

in the presence of dipankara

the arahant the fully enlightened one

sabuti replied no

indeed bhagavan the tatargata did not

obtain any such dharma

in the presence of dipankara the targata

the arahant the fully enlightened one

the buddha said sabuti

if any bodhisattva should thus claim

i shall bring about the transformation

of a world

such a claim would be untrue

and how so the transformation of a

world's

booty the transformation of a world

is said by the tatargata to be no

transformation

thus is it called the transformation of

a world

therefore cebuti fearless bodhisattvas

should thus give birth to a thought that

is not attached

and not give birth to a thought attached

to anything

they should not give birth to a thought

attached to a site

nor should they give birth to a thought

attached to a sound

a smell a taste a touch

or a dharma

sabuti imagine a person with an immense

perfect body whose self-existence is

like that of

mount sumeru what do you think sabuti

would such self-existence be great

sabuti replied

great indeed bhagavan such

self-existence would be great

and why because self-existence bugger

one

self-existence is said by the tatargata

to be no existence

thus is it called self-existence

because bhagawan it is neither existence

nor no existence thus

is it called self-existence

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think if there were as many

rivers

as there are grains of sand in the great

river

of the ganges with the number of grains

of sand

in all those rivers be great

cebuti replied the number of rivers

would be great bugger one

how much more so their grains of sand

the buddha said i shall tell you sabuti

so you shall know

if a man or a woman filled as many

worlds as there are grains of sand

and all those rivers with the seven

jewels

and gave them as a gift to the

tatargatas the arahants

the fully enlightened ones what do you

think sabuti

would the body of merit produced as a

result by that man or woman be great

sabuti replied it would be great

bhagawan

great indeed sugata

the body of merit produced as a result

by that man or woman

would be immeasurable and infinite

the buddha said sabuti

if then a man or woman filled as many

worlds as that

with the seven jewels and gave them as a

gift to the tatargatas

the arahants the fully enlightened ones

and a noble son or daughter grasped but

one

four-line garter of this dharma teaching

and made it known and explained it to

others

the body of merit produced as a result

would be immeasurably infinitely greater

furthermore cebuty wherever but one

foreline gather of this dharma teaching

is spoken

or explained that place is like a stupa

in the world of davis humans

and asuras

how much more shall they be remarkably

bless

bhuti who memorize

recite and master this entire teaching

and explain it in detail to others

for in that place sabuti dwells a

teacher

or one who represents the guru of wisdom

this having been said the venerable cebu

asked bhagawan

what is the name of this dharma teaching

and how should we remember it

the buddha told the venerable cebutti

the name of this dharma teaching cebuti

is the perfection of wisdom

thus should you remember it

and how so sabuti

what the targeter says is the perfection

of wisdom

that a targeter says is no perfection

thus is it called the perfection of

wisdom

sabuti what do you think

is there any such dharma spoken by the

tatargata

sabuti said no indeed bhagavan

there is no such dharma spoken by the

tatargata

the buddha said

what do you think are all the specks of

dust in the billion world system

of a universe many

subuti said many bugawan

the specks of dust are many so guitar

and how so because bugger one

what the targeter says is a speck of

dust bugger one

the targeter says is no speck thus

is it called a speck of dust

and what the target says is a world

system

that a target says is no system

thus is it called a world system

the buddha said

what do you think can the tatargata

the arahant the fully enlightened one

be seen by means of the thirty-two

attributes of a perfect person

sabuti said no indeed bhagavan

the tatargata the arahan the fully

enlightened one

cannot be seen by means of the 32

attributes of a perfect person

and why not because bugger one

what the targeter says are the 32

attributes of a perfect person

bugawan the tatargata says are no

attributes

thus they called the 32 attributes of a

perfect

person

the buddha said furthermore cebuti

if a man or woman renounce their

self-existence

every day as many times as there are

grains of sand in the ganges

and renounce their self-existence in

this manner

for as many culpers as there are grains

of sand

in the ganges and someone grasped

but one full-line garter of this dharma

teaching

and made it known and explained it to

others

the body of merit produced as a result

would be immeasurably infinitely

greater

by the force of this dharma

the venerable cebutti was moved to tears

wiping his eyes he said to the buddha

how remarkable bhagawan how

most remarkable sukhita

is this dharma teaching that the

bhagavan speaks for the benefit of those

beings who seek the foremost of paths

for the benefit of those who seek the

best of paths

and from which my own awareness is born

bugawan i have never heard such a

teaching is this

shall be the most remarkably blessed of

bodhisattvas bhagavan

who hear what is said in this sutra

and give birth to a perception of its

truth

and how so bhagavan

a perception of its truth is no

perception of its truth

thus does the tatargata speak of a

perception of its truth

as a perception of its truth

hearing such a dharma teaching as this

bhagavan

it is not remarkable that i should trust

and believe it

but in the future bugawan in the final

epoch

in the final period in the final 500

years of the dharma ending age

bhagawan those beings who grasp

this dharma teaching and memorize it

recite it master it

and explain it in detail to others

they shall be most remarkably blessed

moreover bhagavan they shall not create

the perception of a self

nor shall they create the perception of

a being

the perception of a life or the

perception of a soul

they shall create neither a perception

nor no perception

and why not bugawan the perception of a

self

is no perception and the perception of a

being

a life or a soul is also no perception

and why not because buddhas

and bugger ones are free of all

perceptions

this having been said the buddha told

the venerable cebutti

so it is cebuty so it is

those beings shall be most remarkably

blessed cebuti

who are not alarmed not frightened

and not distressed by what is said in

this sutra

and how so

sabuti what the tatargata proclaims as

the best of perfections

is in truth no perfection

moreover cebuti what the targeter

proclaims as the best of perfections

is also proclaimed by countless buddhas

and bugger ones

thus is it called the best of

perfections

so to sabuti is the tatargata's

perfection of forbearance

no perfection and how so

cebuty when king khali cut off my limbs

my ears and nose and my flesh

at that moment i had no perception of a

self

a being a life or a soul

i had neither a perception nor no

perception

and why not at that moment sabuti

if i had had the perception of herself

at that moment i would have also had the

perception of anger

or if i had had the perception of a

being the perception of a life

or the perception of a soul

at that moment i would have had the

perception of anger

and how so cebuti

i recall the 500 lifetimes i was the

mendicant kashanti

and during that time i had no perception

of herself

nor did i have the perception of a being

the perception of a life

or the perception of a soul

therefore cebuty fearless bodhisattvas

should get rid of

all perceptions in giving birth to the

thought of

unexcelled perfect enlightenment

they should not give birth to a thought

attached to a sight

nor should they give birth to a thought

attached to a sound

a smell a taste a touch

or a dharma

they should not give birth to a thought

attached to a dharma

nor should they give birth to a thought

attached

to no dharma

they should not give birth to a thought

attached to anything

and why not every attachment

is no attachment

thus the targeter says that bodhisattvas

should give

gifts without being attached

they should give gifts without being

attached to a sight

a sound a smell a taste

a touch or a dharma

moreover bodhisattvas should practice

charity in this manner

for the benefit of all beings

and how so cebuti

the perception of a being is no

perception

likewise all the beings of whom the

target speaks are thus no beings

and how so cebuty

what the tatargata says is real

what the targeter says is true

and as is has he says it is and is not

other than as he says it is

what the targeter says is not false

moreover cebuty in the dharma realized

taught and reflected on by the tatargata

there is nothing true and nothing false

sabuti imagine a person who enters a

dark place and who can't see a thing

he's like a bodhisattva ruled by objects

like someone practicing charity ruled by

objects

now sabuti imagine a person with

eyesight at the end of the night

when the sun shines forth who can see

all manner of things

they are like a bodhisattva not ruled by

objects

like someone practicing charity not

ruled by objects

furthermore cebuty if a noble son or

daughter should grasp this dharma

teaching

and memorize it recite it

master it and explain it in detail to

others

the tatar guitar will know them by means

of his buddha knowledge

and the targeter will see them sabuti by

means of his buddha vision

the tatargata will be aware of them

sabuti

for all such beings produce and obtain

an immeasurable infinite body

of merit

furthermore cebuti if a man or woman

renounce their self-existence during the

morning

as many times as there are grains of

sand in the ganges

and likewise renounce their

self-existence during midday

as many times as there are grains of

sand in the ganges

and renounce their self-existence during

the afternoon

as many times as there are grains of

sand in the ganges

and renounce their self-existence in

this manner

for many hundreds and thousands of

millions

and trillions of culpers

and someone heard this dharma teaching

and did not reject it

the body of merit produced as a result

would be immeasurably infinitely greater

how much more so if they not only wrote

it down

but grasped it memorized it

recited it mastered it

and explained it in detail to others

furthermore cebuti inconceivable

and incomparable is this dharma teaching

this dharma teaching spoken by the

tatargata sabuti

for the benefit of those beings who set

forth on the foremost of paths

for the benefit of those beings who set

forth on the best of paths

for if someone grasps memorizes

recites and masters this dharma teaching

and explains it in detail to others

the targeter will know them sabuti

by means of his buddha knowledge

and the tatargatub will see them sabuti

by means of his buddha vision

the tatargata will be aware of them

sabuti

for all such beings produce a body of

merit

that has no limits a body of merit that

is inconceivable

incomparable immeasurable

and boundless

for all such beings as these cebuti

likewise wear enlightenment upon their

shoulders

and how so

sabuti this dharma teaching

cannot be heard by beings of lesser

aspiration

not by those who mistakenly perceive a

self

nor by those who mistakenly perceive a

being

a life or a soul

for beings who lack the bodhisattva's

aspiration

cannot hear grasp memorize

recite or master this dharma teaching

moreover wherever this sutra

is explained that place shall be honored

whether in the realm of davis humans

or assurers that place shall be honored

with prostrations and circumambulations

that place shall be like a stupa

nevertheless the noble son or daughter

who grasps

memorizes recites and masters such a

sutra as this

and contemplates it thoroughly and

explains it in detail to others

will suffer their contempt their utter

contempt

and how could this be sabuti

the bad karma created by these beings in

their past lives

should result in an unfortunate rebirth

but now by suffering such contempt

they put an end to the bad karma of

their past lives

and attain the enlightenment of buddhas

sabuti i recall in the past

during the countless infinite culprits

before depankara

tagta the arahant the fully enlightened

one

i served 8 400 000 million trillion

other buddhas and serve them without

fail

nevertheless cebuti although i serve

those buddhas and bugger ones and serve

them without fail

in the future in the final epoch

in the final period in the final 500

years of the dharma ending age

the body of merit of the person who

grasps

memorizes recites and masters such a

sutra as this

and explains it in detail to others

will exceed my former body of merit

not by a hundred fold or a thousand fold

or a hundred thousand fold or a million

fold

or a hundred million fold or a thousand

million fold

or a hundred thousand million fold

but by an amount that can't be measured

calculated illustrated

characterized or even imagined

sabuti if i were to describe this noble

son or daughter's body of merit

the full extent of the body of merit

this noble son or daughter

would thereby produce and obtain

it would bewilder or disturb people's

minds

furthermore cebuty inconceivable

and incomparable is this dharma teaching

spoken by the tatargata

and inconceivable is the result

you should expect

again the venerable cebutti asked the

buddha

bugger one if someone sets forth on the

bodhisattva path

how should they stand how should they

walk

and how should they control their

thoughts

the buddha said

[Music]

someone who sets forth on the

bodhisattva path

should give birth to the thought

in the realm of complete nirvana i

shall liberate all beings

and while i thus liberate beings

not a single being is liberated

and why not sabuti

a bodhisattva who creates the perception

of a being

cannot be called a bodhisattva

neither can someone who creates a

perception of a life

or even the perception of a soul be

called the bodhisattva

and why not sabuti

there is no such dharma as setting

forth on the bodhisattva path

what do you think sabuti when the

tatargata was with the pankara to

targata

did he realize any such dharma as

unexcelled perfect

enlightenment

to this the venerable cebutti answered

bugger one as i understand the meaning

of what the

targeter is taught when the targeter was

with the pankara to targata

the arahant the fully enlightened one

he did not realize any such dharma as

unexcelled perfect enlightenment

and to this the buddha replied

so it is sabuti so it is

when the tatargata was with tapankara to

targata

the arahant the fully enlightened one

he did not realize any such dharma

as unexcelled perfect enlightenment

sabuti if the tatargata had realized any

dharma

dapankara tatargata would not have

prophesized

young man in the future you shall become

the tatargata

the arahan the fully enlightened one

named shakyamuni

sabuti it was because the tatargata

the arhant the fully enlightened one

did not realize any such dharma as

unexcelled perfect enlightenment

that the punkara tatargata prophesized

young man in the future you shall become

the

targata the arahant

the fully enlightened one named shakira

muni

and how so tatargata

sabuti is another name for what is truly

real

tatargata sabuti is another name for the

dharma

with no beginning

tatargata sabuti is another name for the

end of dharmas

tatargata sabuti is another name

for what never begins

and how so

no beginning sabuti is the highest truth

sabuti if anyone should claim

the arahant the fully enlightened one

realized unexcelled perfect

enlightenment

such a claim would be untrue

they would be making a false statement

about me

and how so subbuti the tatargata did not

realize any such dharma

as unexcelled perfect enlightenment

furthermore sabuti in the dharma

realized or taught by the tatargata

there is nothing true and nothing false

thus the targeter says

all dharmas are buddhadharmas

and how so all dharma's cebuti

are said by the tatargata to be no

dharmas

thus are all dharmas called

buddhadharmas

imagine a perfect person with an immense

perfect body

the venerable cebutti said bhagawan

this perfect person whom the tatargata

says

has an immense perfect body bhagawan

that a targeter says

has no body thus

it is called an immense perfect body

the buddha said so it is sabuti

and if a bodhisattva says i shall

liberate other beings

that person is not called a bodhisattva

and why not sabuti

is there any such dharma as a

bodhisattva

the venable sabuti replied

no indeed bhagawan there is no such

dharma

as a bodhisattva

the buddha said and being sabuti

beings are said by the tatargata to be

no beings

thus they called beings

and thus does the targeter say

all dharmas have no self

all dharmas have no life

no individuality

and no soul

sabuti if the bodhisattva should thus

claim

i shall bring about the transformation

of a world

such a claim would be untrue

and how so the transformation of a world

cebuti

the transformation of a world is said by

the tatargata

to be no transformation

thus is it called the transformation

of a world

when a bodhisattva resolves on selfless

dharmas

as selfless dharmas

the tatargata the arahant

the fully enlightened one pronounces

that person

a fearless bodhisattva

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think does the tattagata

possess a physical eye

sabuti replied so

he does bugger one the targeter

possesses a physical eye

the buddha said

what do you think does the tatargata

possess a divine

eye sabuti replied

so he does bugawan the tatargata

possesses a divine eye

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think does the tatargata

possess a prachna eye

sabuti replied so he does bugawan

the targeter possesses a prajna i

the buddha said sabuti what do you think

does the tatargata possess a dharma eye

sabuchi replied so he does bugawan

the tatargata possesses a dharma eye

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think does the tatakata

possess

our buddha eye

sabuti replied so he does

bugawat that the target possesses a

buddha eye

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think as many grains of sand

as there are in the great river of the

ganges

does the targeted not speak of them as

grains of sand

sabuti replied so he does bugger one

so he does sugata the tatargata speaks

of them as grains of sand

the buddha said what do you think sabuti

if there were as many rivers as all the

grains of sand in the great river of the

ganges

and as many worlds as there are grains

of sand

in all these rivers would there be many

worlds

cebuty replied

so there would be bugawan so there would

suguta

there would be many worlds

the buddha said and as many beings

as there might be in those worlds

i would know their myriad streams of

thought

and how so streams of thought sabuti

what the targeters speaks of as streams

of thought

are no streams

thus are they called streams of thought

and how so cebuti

a past thought cannot be found

a future thought cannot be found

nor can a present thought be found

so booty what do you think

if some noble son or daughter filled the

billion worlds of this universe

with the seven jewels and gave them all

as a gift to the targeters the arahants

the fully enlightened ones with the body

of merit produced as a result by that

noble son or daughter

be great sabuti replied

great indeed bugger one it would be

great sugata

the buddha said so it would sabuti

so it would the body of merit produced

as a result by that noble son or

daughter

would be immeasurably infinitely great

and how so a body of merit sabuti

a body of merit is spoken of by the

tatar guitar as nobody

thus is it called a body of merit

sabuti if there were a body of merit

that the targeter would not have spoken

of the body of merit

as a body of merit

what do you think

can the tatargata be seen by means of

the perfect development of the physical

body

sabuti replied

no indeed bhagawan the tatargata cannot

be seen by means of the perfect

development of the physical body

and why not the perfect development of

the physical body bugger one

the perfect development of the physical

body

is spoken of the tatargata by no

development

thus is it called the perfect

development of the physical body

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think can the tatargata be

seen by means of the possession of

attributes

sabuti replied no indeed

bugger one the tatargata cannot be seen

by means of the possession of attributes

and why not bugawan

what the targeter speaks of as the

possession of attributes

is spoken of by the tatargata as no

possession of attributes

thus is it called the possession of

attributes

the buddha said sabuti

what do you think does it occur to the

tatargata

i teach a dharma

sabuti replied no indeed bugawan

it does not occur to the tata guitar i

teacher dharma

the buddha said sabuti

if someone should claim the targeter

teaches a dharma

such a claim would be untrue

such a view of me cebuty would be a

misconception

and how so

in the teaching of a dharma cebuty in

the teaching of a dharma

there is no such dharma to be found

as the teaching of the dharma

upon hearing this the venerable sabooti

asked the buddha

bugger one will there be any beings in

the future

in the final epoch in the final period

in the final 500 years of the dharma

ending age

who hear a dharma such as this

and believe it

the buddha said neither being

sabooti nor no beings

and how so being

sabooti beings

are all spoken of by the tatargata

cebuti

as no beings

thus are they called beings

what do you think did the

targeter realize any such dharma as

unexcelled perfect enlightenment

the venerable sabuti replied

no indeed bhagavan the tatargata did not

realize any such dharma

bhagavan has unexcelled perfect

enlightenment

the buddha said so it is cebuti

so it is the slightest dharma

is neither obtained nor found therein

thus is it called unexcelled

perfect enlightenment

furthermore cebuty

undifferentiated is this dharma

in which nothing is differentiated

thus is it called unexcelled

perfect enlightenment

without a self without a being

without a life without a soul

undifferentiated is this unexcelled

perfect enlightenment by means of which

all auspicious dharmas are realized

and how so auspicious dharma cebuty

auspicious dharmas are spoken of by the

tata gta

as no dharmas

thus are they called auspicious dharmas

moreover cebuti if a man or woman

brought together

as many piles of the seven jewels as all

the mount sumerus in the billion worlds

of the universe and gave them as a gift

to the tatargatas

the arahants the fully enlightened ones

and a noble son or daughter grasped but

a single

four-line gather of this dharma teaching

of the perfection of wisdom and made it

known to others

sabuti their body of merit would be

greater

by more than a hundredfold indeed

by an amount beyond comparison

tsubuti what do you think

does it occur to the targeter

i rescue beings

surely sabuti you should hold no such

view

and why not sabuti

the being does not exist who is rescued

by the tatargata

tsubuti if any being were rescued by the

tatargata

the tatargata would be attached to a

self

he would be attached to a being attached

to a life

and attached to a soul

attachment to a self cebuty

is said by the tatargata to be

no attachment

yet foolish people remain attached

and foolish people cebuti are said by

the tatargata

to be no people thus

are they called foolish people

sabuti what do you think

can the targeter be seen by means of the

possession of attributes

sabuchi replied no indeed bhagavan

as i understand the meaning of what the

buddha says

the tatargata cannot be seen by means of

the possession of attributes

the buddha said well done sabuti

well done so it is subuti

it is as you claim

the tatargata cannot be seen by means of

the possession of

attributes and why not

sabuti if the tatargata could be seen by

means of the possession of attributes

a universal king would be a tatargata

hence the tatargata cannot be seen by

means of the possession

of attributes

the venerable cebu said to the buddha

as i understand the meaning of what the

buddha says

the targeter cannot be seen by means of

the possession of

attributes

on that occasion the buddha then spoke

discarter

who looks for me in form who seeks me in

a voice

indulges in wasted effort

such people see me not

sabuti what do you think

was it due to the possession of

attributes that the tatargata realized

unexcelled perfect enlightenment

sabuti you should hold no such view

and why not sabuti

it could not have been due to the

possession of attributes

that the tatargata realized unexcelled

perfect enlightenment

furthermore cebuti someone may claim

those who set forth on the bodhisattva

path

announce the destruction or the end of

some dharma

sabuti you should hold no such view

and why not those who set forth on the

bodhisattva path

do not announce a destruction or the end

of any dharma

furthermore cebutti if a noble son or

daughter took as many worlds as there

are grains of sand in the ganges

and covered them with the seven jewels

and gave them as a gift to the

targeters the arahants the fully

enlightened ones

and a bodhisattva gained an acceptance

of the selfless birthless nature of

dharmas

the body of merit produced as a result

would be immeasurably

infinitely greater

and yet sabuti this fearless bodhisattva

would not obtain a body of merit

the venerable cebutti said

but surely bhagavan this bodhisattva

would obtain a body of merit

the buddha replied they would sabootie

but without grasping it

thus is it called obtaining

furthermore cebuty if anyone should

claim that the

targeter goes or comes or stands

or sits or lies on a bed

sabuti they do not understand the

meaning of my words

and why not cebuti those who

are called to targeters do not go

anywhere

nor do they come from anywhere

thus they called to targeters

arahants fully enlightened ones

furthermore cebuty if a noble son or

daughter

took as many worlds as there are specks

of dust in a billion world universe

and by an expenditure of limitless

energy

ground them into a multitude of atoms

sabuti what do you think would there be

a great multitude of atoms

sabuti replied

so they would bugawan so there would

sugata

there would be a great multitude of

atoms

and why if a great multitude of atoms

existed bhagawan

the tatargata would not have spoken of a

multitude of atoms

and why bhagawan is multitude of atoms

of which the

target speaks is said by the

targeter to be no multitude

thus is it called a multitude of atoms

also bugger this billion world universe

of which the

targeter speaks is said by the

target to be no universe

thus is it called a billion world

universe

and how so bugger one

if a universe existed attachment to an

entity would exist

but whenever the targeter speaks of

attachment to an entity

that the target speaks of it as no

attachment

thus is it called attachment to an

entity

the buddha said sabuti

attachment to an entity is inexplainable

and inexpressible

for it is neither a dharma

nor no dharma

foolish people though are attached

and how so sabuti if someone should

claim that the targeter speaks of a view

of a self or that the targeter speaks of

a view

of a being a view of a life

or a view of a soul sabuti

would such a claim be true

sabuti said no indeed bugawan

no indeed sugata such a claim would not

be true

and why not bhagavan when the

targeter speaks of a view of the self

the target speaks of it as no view

thus is it called a view of a self

the buddha said indeed sabuti

so it is those who set forth on the

bodhisattva path

know see and believe all

dharmas but know

see and believe them without being

attached

to the perception of a dharma

and why not the perception of a dharma

cebutti

the perception of a dharma is said by

the

targeter to be no perception

thus is it called the perception

of a dharma

furthermore cebuti if a fearless

bodhisattva

filled measureless infinite worlds with

the seven jewels

and gave them as an offering to the

targeters

the arahants the fully enlightened ones

and a noble son or daughter grasped

but a single foreline garter of this

teaching

on the perfection of wisdom and

memorized

discussed recited

mastered and explained it in detail to

others

the body of merit produced by that noble

son or daughter

as a result would be immeasurably

infinitely greater

and how should they explain it

by not explaining thus

is it called explaining

as a lamp a cataract

a star in space an illusion

a dew drop a bubble

a dream a cloud

a flash of lightning

view all created things

like this

all this was spoken by the buddha to the

joy of the elder cebuti

the monks and nuns the laymen

and lay women the bodhisattvas

the davis humans

asuras and gandavas of the world

all of whom were greatly pleased

with what the buddha said

[Music]

do

[Music]

you
