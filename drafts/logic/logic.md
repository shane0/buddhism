# logic symbols

Below are tables summarizing the **logic symbols** used to formalize the Buddhist teaching on suffering (*dukkha*), along with their meanings and examples:

---

### **Table 1: Propositional Logic Symbols**

| Symbol | Name                | Meaning                                  | Example from the Analysis              |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **→**  | Implication         | "If... then"                             | `P₁ → S` (If birth occurs, there is suffering). |
| **∧**  | Conjunction         | "And"                                    | `(P₁ → S) ∧ (P₂ → S)` (Birth and decay imply suffering). |
| **S**  | Proposition         | "There is suffering (ill)."              | Used as the conclusion in all implications. |
| **P₁–P₇** | Propositions    | Individual causes of suffering (e.g., birth, death). | `P₅ = "Being conjoined with what one dislikes."` |

### **Table 2: Quantifiers and Predicates**

| Symbol | Name                | Meaning                                  | Example from the Analysis              |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **∀**  | Universal Quantifier | "For all"                               | `∀x(Q(x) → S)` (Grasping at **any** skandha *x* implies suffering). |
| **Q(x)** | Predicate          | "Grasping at skandha *x*"               | `Q(form) → S` (Grasping at the skandha of "form" leads to suffering). |
| **x**  | Variable            | Represents one of the Five Skandhas      | `x ∈ {form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness}`. |

### **Table 3: Domains and Definitions**

| Term                | Definition                                                                 | Example                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Five Skandhas**   | The aggregates constituting human existence in Buddhism.                  | Form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness. |
| **Suffering (S)**   | The universal truth of unsatisfactoriness (*dukkha*).                     | All conditions (birth, death, etc.) lead to `S`. |

---

### **Summary of Logical Structure**

1. **Individual Causes**:  
   $$
   (P₁ \rightarrow S) \land (P₂ \rightarrow S) \land \dots \land (P₇ \rightarrow S)
   $$
2. **Universal Cause**:  
   $$
   \forall x \big( Q(x) \rightarrow S \big)
   $$

### **Key Takeaways**

- The logic symbols formalize the **First Noble Truth of Buddhism**: Suffering arises from specific conditions and grasping at the Five Skandhas.  
- The universal quantifier (**∀**) emphasizes that **all forms of clinging** (to any skandha) lead to suffering.
