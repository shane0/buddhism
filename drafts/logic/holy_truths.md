# 4 holy truths

To represent the Buddhist teaching on suffering (*dukkha*) from the passage using **formal logic symbols**, we can break it down as follows:

> What then is the Holy Truth of Ill? Birth is ill, decay is ill, sickness is ill, death is ill. To be conjoined with what one dislikes means suffering. To be disjoined from what one likes means suffering. Not to get what one wants, also that means suffering. In short, all grasping at (any of) the five skandhas (involves) suffering.

### **1. Define Propositions**

- Let **S** = "There is suffering (ill)."
- Let:
  - **P‚ÇÅ** = "Birth occurs."  
  - **P‚ÇÇ** = "Decay occurs."  
  - **P‚ÇÉ** = "Sickness occurs."  
  - **P‚ÇÑ** = "Death occurs."  
  - **P‚ÇÖ** = "Being conjoined with what one dislikes."  
  - **P‚ÇÜ** = "Being disjoined from what one likes."  
  - **P‚Çá** = "Not getting what one wants."  
  - **Q(x)** = "Grasping at skandha *x*" (where *x* ranges over the Five Skandhas: form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness).

### **2. Formalize the Statements**

$$
P‚ÇÅ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÇ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÉ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÑ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÖ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÜ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚Çá \rightarrow S  
$$

#### **Individual Causes of Suffering**  

Each condition implies suffering:  

$$
P‚ÇÅ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÇ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÉ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÑ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÖ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚ÇÜ \rightarrow S, \quad  
P‚Çá \rightarrow S  
$$

#### **Universal Suffering via the Five Skandhas**  

Grasping at **any** of the Five Skandhas (*x*) entails suffering:  

$$
\forall x \big( Q(x) \rightarrow S \big)  
$$

---

### **3. Integrated Formula**  

Combining all premises:  

$$
(P‚ÇÅ \rightarrow S) \land (P‚ÇÇ \rightarrow S) \land \dots \land (P‚Çá \rightarrow S) \land \forall x \big( Q(x) \rightarrow S \big)  
$$

### **4. Legend**  

- **‚Üí**: Material implication ("if... then").  
- **‚àß**: Logical conjunction ("and").  
- **‚àÄ**: Universal quantifier ("for all").  
- **Q(x)**: Grasping at one of the Five Skandhas.  

---

### **Summary**  

The formula asserts that **each individual condition** (birth, decay, etc.) and **all grasping at the Five Skandhas** necessarily lead to suffering. This aligns with the Buddha‚Äôs First Noble Truth: *"Life is suffering (dukkha)."*
