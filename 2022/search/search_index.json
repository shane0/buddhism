Medieval and contemporary texts typically describe six realms of reincarnation.</p> <p>See also: Desire realm, Bhavacakra, and Ghost Festival</p> <p>Buddhist cosmology typically identifies six realms of rebirth and existence: gods, demi-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hells.[39] Earlier Buddhist texts refer to five realms rather than six realms; when described as five realms, the god realm and demi-god realm constitute a single realm.</p> <p>The six realms are typically divided into three higher realms (good, fortunate) and three lower realms (evil, unfortunate). The three higher realms are the realms of the gods, humans and demi-gods; the three lower realms are the realms of the animals, hungry ghosts and hell beings. The six realms are organized into thirty one levels in east Asian literature. Buddhist texts describe these realms as follows:</p> <p>Gods realm: the gods (devas) is the most pleasure-filled among the six realms, and typically subdivided into twenty six sub-realms. A rebirth in this heavenly realm is believed to be from very good karma accumulation. A Deva does not need to work, and is able to enjoy in the heavenly realm all pleasures found on earth. However, the pleasures of this realm lead to attachment (Up\u0101d\u0101na ), lack of spiritual pursuits and therefore no nirvana. The vast majority of Buddhist lay people, states Kevin Trainor, have historically pursued Buddhist rituals and practices motivated with rebirth into Deva realm.[note 6] The Deva realm in Buddhist practice in southeast and east Asia, states Keown, include gods found in Hindu traditions such as Indra and Brahma, and concepts in Hindu cosmology such as Mount Meru.</p> <p>Human realm: called the manu\u1e63ya realm. Buddhism asserts that one is reborn in this realm with vastly different physical endowments and moral natures because of a being's past karma. A rebirth in this realm is considered as fortunate because it offers an opportunity to attain nirvana and end the Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra cycle.</p> <p>Demi-god realm (Asura): the demi-gods (asuras) is the third realm of existence in Buddhism. Asura are notable for their anger and some supernatural powers. They fight with the Devas (gods), or trouble the Manusya (humans) through illnesses and natural disasters. They accumulate karma, and are reborn. Demi-god is sometimes ranked as one of the evil realms as there are stories of them fighting against the Gods.</p> <p>Animal realm: is state of existence of a being as an animal (tiryag). This realm is traditionally thought to be similar to a hellish realm, because animals are believed in Buddhist texts to be driven by impulse and instinct, they prey on each other and suffer. Some Buddhist texts assert that plants belong to this realm, with primitive consciousness.</p> <p>Hungry Ghosts realm of Buddhist samsara, a 12th-century painting from Kyoto Japan</p> <p>Hungry ghost realm: hungry ghosts and other restless spirits (preta) are rebirths caused by karma of excessive craving and attachments. They do not have a body, are invisible and constitute only \"subtle matter\" of a being. Buddhist texts describe them as beings who are extremely thirsty and hungry, very small mouths but very large stomachs. Buddhist traditions in Asia attempt to care for them on ritual days every year, by leaving food and drinks in open, to feed any hungry ghosts nearby. When their bad karma demerit runs out, these beings are reborn into another realm. According to McClelland, this realm is the mildest of the three evil realms. According to Yangsi Rinpoche, in contrast, the suffering of the beings born in the realm of the hungry ghosts is far more intense than those born in the animal realm.</p> <p>Hell realm: beings in hell (naraka) enter this realm for evil karma such as theft, lying, adultery and others. The texts vary in their details, but typically describe numerous hellish regions each with different forms of intense suffering, such as eight extremely hot hellish realms, eight extremely cold, being partially eaten alive, beating and other forms of torture in proportion to the evil karma accumulated. These beings are reborn in another realm after their evil karma has run its course, they die, and they get another chance. This realm is not similar to afterlife hell in Christianity, states Damien Keown, because in Buddhism there is no realm of final damnation and existence in this realm is also a temporary state.</p>"},{"location":"books/confusion-to-clarity/#four-unique-practices","title":"four unique practices","text":"<ul> <li>taking refuge</li> <li>purification</li> <li>mandala offering</li> <li>guru yoga</li> </ul>"},{"location":"books/confusion-to-clarity/#ten-endowments","title":"ten endowments","text":"<ul> <li>birth</li> <li>bodh gaya  -

Alle Materie entsteht und besteht nur durch eine Kraft, welche die Atomteilchen in Schwingung bringt und sie zum winzigsten Sonnensystem des Alls zusammenh\u00e4lt.

Having said that, I would like to observe that my research on the atom has shown me that there is no such thing as matter in itself. What we perceive as matter is merely the manifestation of a force that causes the subatomic particles to oscillate and holds them together in the tiniest solar system of the universe. Since there is in the whole universe neither an intelligent force nor an eternal force (mankind, for all its yearnings, has yet to succeed in inventing a perpetual motion machine), we must assume that this force that is active within the atom comes from a conscious and intelligent mind. That mind is the ultimate source of matter.\"</p> <p>Eine neue wissenschaftliche Wahrheit pflegt sich nicht in der Weise durchzusetzen, da\u00df ihre Gegner \u00fcberzeugt werden und sich als belehrt erkl\u00e4ren, sondern vielmehr dadurch, da\u00df ihre Gegner allm\u00e4hlich aussterben und da\u00df die heranwachsende Generation von vornherein mit der Wahrheit vertraut gemacht ist. \u2026 Eine neue gro\u00dfe wissenschaftliche Idee pflegt sich nicht in der Weise durchzusetzen, da\u00df ihre Gegner allm\u00e4hlich \u00fcberzeugt und bekehrt werden \u2014 da\u00df aus einem Saulus ein Paulus wird, ist eine gro\u00dfe Seltenheit \u2014, sondern vielmehr in der Weise, dass die Gegner allm\u00e4hlich aussterben und da\u00df die heranwachsende Generation von vornherein mit der Idee vertraut gemacht wird.

This instruction alone is able to give us the inner firmness and lasting peace of mind which must be regarded as the highest boon in life. And if we ascribe to God, in addition to His omnipotence and omniscience, also the attributes of goodness and love, recourse to Him produces an increased feeling of safety and happiness in the human being thirsting for solace. Against this conception not even the slightest objection can be raised from the point of natural science, for as we pointed it out before, questions of ethics are entirely outside of its realm.</p> <p>No matter where and how far we look, nowhere do we find a contradiction between religion and natural science. On the contrary, we find a complete concordance in the very points of decisive importance. Religion and natural science do not exclude each other, as many contemporaries of ours would believe or fear. They mutually supplement and condition each other. The most immediate proof of the compatibility of religion and natural science, even under the most thorough critical scrutiny, is the historical fact that the very greatest natural scientists of all times\u2014men such as Kepler, Newton, Leibniz\u2014were permeated by a most profound religious attitude.</p> <p>Religion and natural science are fighting a joint battle in an incessant, never relaxing crusade against scepticism and against dogmatism, against disbelief and against superstition, and the rallying cry in this crusade has always been, and always will be: \"On to God!\"</p>"},{"location":"teachers/mingyur/","title":"yongey mingyur rinpoche","text":"<p>i first heard mingyur in a conversation with sam harris on the waking up app</p> <p>tergar</p> <p>books read</p> <ul> <li> turning confusion into clarity</li> </ul> <p>Quotes</p> <p>\"you can meditate anytime, anywhere, using anything...\"</p> <p>\"the real measure is what happens off the cusion\"</p> <p>\"awareness is the essence of meditation\" </p> <p>\"what really counts is what happens off the cusion\" &lt;-- this is big for me, every moment is an opportunity for you to take pause and consider your awareness, turn to your self, as the observer, then consider worthy intentions to stay on your path</p>"},{"location":"teachers/plato/","title":"plato","text":"<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato</p> <p>https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/879.Plato</p>"},{"location":"teachers/ramdass/","title":"ram dass","text":"<p>one of the best mantras</p> <p>\"I am loving awareness\"</p>"},{"location":"teachers/sadhguru/","title":"Sadhguru","text":""},{"location":"teachers/sadhguru/#2020-07-06","title":"2020-07-06","text":"<ul> <li>breath in - i am not my body</li> <li>breath out - i am not my mind</li> </ul> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2dY1VW14lw</p> <pre><code>Interviewer (Karan Johar): I\u2019m going to take the liberty, Sadhguru,\nto do what I normally do on my television show,\nwhich is a rapid fire round.\nSadhguru: Mhmm (Indicating agreement) (Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Normally the end of this round..\nSadhguru: (Overlapping conversation) See, I\u2019ve\u2026 When I was young,\nI watched a lot of, you know,\nWild West movies (Karan Johar laughs).\nWhen you fire, I also fire, all right ?(Laughter/Applause)\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): No, but I promise you,\nthis is not that kind of..\nyou are not in my line of fire (Sadhguru laughs) at all.\nI will not take the liberty of being that person (Laughs).\nThese are just quick questions, which when I ask for one word,\nyou have to stick to that\nbecause sometimes you have a tendency of not exactly answering the question asked (Laughter).\nBut you give such a profound and prolific retort back that it makes you very satiated.\nBut in this case, my only request is that if it\u2019s one word,\nthen it\u2019s just one word (Laughs).\nSadhguru: Okay.\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): And the end of this normally,\nyou get a hamper (Laughter).\nBut in the absence of a hamper here, you already have\nSadhguru: A cow (Laughter).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): \u2026something right\u2026 Yes.\nSo (Laughs)\u2026 And\u2026 Or this beautiful bouquet that is right next to you.\nBut so there is no hamper\nbut you do will get my utmost gratitude (Both laugh).\nThank you.\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): All right, very simply,\nwhat is the one thing that is essential to living a balanced life?\nSadhguru: Sense (Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): What is the one thing we must absolutely do away with\nin order to lead a balanced life?\nSadhguru: Senselessness (Laughter/Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): All right,\nI thought that was coming.\nFirst thing that comes to your mind when I say the following \u2013\nthe first thing.

Mars,\nwe want to travel to another place.\nAnd now that\u2019s not enough,\nwe want to travel into the past and future.\nAll this longing is again exploratory in nature.\nWhether you go on vacation

why can\u2019t you do it here?\nIt\u2019s something that you want to do,\nyou want to touch another place.\nThis longing is there in the human being\nonly as long as the life that you are remains in a seed form,\nthat is, it did not sprout and blossom.\nThis happened.\nWhen Adiyogi was expounding the science of yoga\nand talking about the nature of the cosmos,\nhow it\u2019s related to your individual self\nand what you can do with it,\nthen the seven sages who were with him,\nthey asked, \u201cWhat is the nature of this cosmos?\nHow big is it?\nWhere does it begin, where does it end?\u201d\nSo he laughed and said,\n\u201cYour entire cosmos, I can pack it into a mustard seed.\u201d\nBecause your ideas of time and space are essentially\nbecause you\u2019re living within the framework of your intellect.\nIf you cross that dimension,\nthen there is no such thing as time and space.\nEverything is here and now.\nSo, traveling through time, space \u2013\nno, it means nothing to me because...\nIt\u2019s difficult to express,\ndifficult to articulate.\nIf I sound little..\nI have a reputation of being very logical\nbut if I sound illogical or silly to you,\nyou can blame it on my jetlag.\nI\u2019ve just come from United States after six weeks,\nso you can say,\n\u201cMaybe he was jetlagged, that\u2019s why Sadhguru\u2019s saying something silly.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m fine.\nI\u2019m saying this because\nyou can't fit the universe into your silly little logic.\nToday\u2019s human being is too overly enamored with their own logic,\nthat they\u2019re missing the entire life.\nThe gamut of phenomena that\u2019s happening in the existence is missed\nbecause the only way you can accept anything is\nit has to fit into the square hole of your logic.\nAnything that doesn\u2019t fit into your logic,\nyou will reject.\nIn this, you\u2019ve rejected the entire cosmos.\nIn this, you\u2019ve rejected the magic of life.\nYou have become a slave of logic\nand completely missing the magic of life.\nSo, this time, space, all this stuff is because\nintellectually you\u2019re trying to dissect the universe\nand try to understand this, this, this.\nTell me, if you sit here,\nsuppose you\u2019re very joyful,\ndo you see, you will not know how the day passed off?\nAnd if you\u2019re depressed,\ndo you see the day won\u2019t pass?\nSo time is a consequence of the miserable nature of human existence.\nIf you were truly blissed out and ecstatic,\nyou wouldn\u2019t know what is a day,\nwhat is a year,\nwhat is a lifetime.\nYou wouldn\u2019t know.\nThere\u2019ve been times, I sat down,\nI didn\u2019t realize, I thought it\u2019s five minutes\nbut people gathered around and started molesting my feet (Laughter).\nNo, because they...\nin their understanding I sat there for many days or whatever.\nThis idea of time and space is a very convoluted idea,\nsimply because people are stuck in the framework of their logic.\nMy work, my fundamental work is to take people\nbeyond the framework of logic into the true magic of existence,\nour own existence.\nBut it takes a lot of time.\nStill my reputation is of being very logically correct\nbecause I\u2019m still trying to woo them, tch (Both laugh).\nStill wooing them, you know (Laughs)?\nFor the real thing to happen,\nthey will take a long time unfortunately\nbecause they have become such slaves of their logic.\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): What is the first thing you notice when you meet a person?\nSadhguru: Just everything.\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Everything?\nSadhguru: Everything. Past, present and future (Karan Johar laughs) (Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Is it more important to do what you love or love what you\u2019re doing?\nSadhguru: One word or more (Laughter)?\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): The choice is entirely yours.\nSadhguru: See, if you are an intelligent person, you will try to do what you love most.\nBut if you\u2019re a genius, you will do just what is needed (Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): If you could be invisible for a day, what would you do (Laughter)?\nSadhguru: You wouldn\u2019t know (Laughter/Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): With due respect, what is your biggest weakness?\nSadhguru: Hmm? Biggest (Laughter)?\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): What is your biggest weakness?\nSadhguru: See, what normally people treat as weakness in their lives...\nOkay, let me give a normal answer,\nwhy...\nwhy am I going into all this?\nAlready you said I\u2019m... what?\nWhat is the word?\nSashayed hmm (Both laugh)?\nMy biggest weakness is I love danger.\nWithout danger, I cannot live.\nI need to do something, which...\nwhich keeps me on the edge of being mortal,\nbeing alive and dead.\nI want to walk that line all the time.\nEvery day I\u2019m stepping on it one way or the other (Few applaud).\nIs it a weakness?\nI don\u2019t think so,\nbut people think. \u201cSadhguru, you shouldn\u2019t risk your life like this.\u201d\nBut if there\u2019s no risk,\nI feel I\u2019m not being...\nBecause most of the time in my life,\nfor whatever I\u2019m doing,\nI don\u2019t feel tested.\nIt\u2019s only in moments of danger that I feel little tested.\nSo my weakness is, I like to be stretched, you know?\nFor all the time when I was riding across India\nand later on I started driving,\nmy only wish was that... to find a machine,\nwhich will test my skills.\nAlways found the damn things broke down if I took it to my limits.\nThese days recently,\nI\u2019m beginning to get to do a few machines,\nwhich are testing me,\nwhether I can push it all the way or not (Both laugh).\nMaybe that\u2019s because of my age (Karan Johar laughs).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): No.\nSadhguru: If I had met them much younger, I think I would have\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): You would have managed to work around them (Sadhguru laughs).\nOne thing the world doesn\u2019t know about you?\nSadhguru: They don\u2019t know a thing about me (Laughter/Applause).\nThat\u2019s a fact (Both laugh).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): And the one thing you wish you could change about yourself?\nSadhguru: Oh, I never looked at that (Few laugh).\nI could speak Hindi (Laughter/Applause).\nNo, I\u2019m sorry, Marathi (Laughter/Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): The one thing you wish you could change about the world?\nSadhguru: Tch, oh, a lot of things.\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): One.\nSadhguru: Human beings (Laughter).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Desperately in need of (Sadhguru laughs).\nSir, what would you consider to be your greatest achievement?\nSadhguru: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any\nbecause I always fall woefully short of my own expectation of what I could do (Applause).\nSo, I never feel anything is an achievement (Laughs).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Is there a song you love\nand can listen to all the time?\nSadhguru: Oh (Laughs)! I somehow...\n(Someone starts singing Tamil song Alai Alai) (Laughter)\nNo (Laughs).\nProbably because this came to me at a certain time\nwhen I was in my early teens maybe,\nso this one song kind of comes back to me more often than anything else.\nIt\u2019s not that I even seek it but somehow, one way or the other,\nthis song keeps coming back to me, is\n\u201cHow many times\u201d (Referring to Blowing in the Wind by Bob Dylan) (Both laugh).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Okay, okay. I know you haven\u2019t seen any of my films\nbut do you have a favorite film?\nSadhguru: Oh! I\u2019ve seen many good movies.\nAt one time, I saw a lot of them.\nI\u2019ve not seen much of Indian cinema\nbut I saw a lot of, you know, English cinema.\nBut one movie that I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed at that time\nbecause on that day the way things happened,\nmany life situations fell together and everything,\nwas Roman Holiday.\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Oh (Applause)!\nWell, I have to say that that\u2019s the first film I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\nmy mother took me to the cinema (Sadhguru laughs).\nSadhguru: Here we are!\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): It is true,\nRoman Holiday is the first film I ever saw,\nit was my introduction to the big screen (Sadhguru laughs).\nI\u2019m glad I have something in common with you (Laughter).\nSadhguru: That image of Audrey and Gregory Peck is...\nsomehow just stayed with me (Laughs).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Wonderful.\nSadhguru: It was probably my age (Both laugh).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): Yeah, it must have been.\nSomething you enjoy doing and wish you had more time for?\nSadhguru: I wish I had more time\nbecause I made myself like this,\nthat there is nothing that I enjoy or do not enjoy.\nI make sure I enjoy everything that I do,\nincluding simply sitting quietly,\nor talking to somebody or doing whatever.\nBecause my activity is not limited to one area,\nso many things.\nIf you did not enjoy everything that you do and do not do,\nyou will go insane trying to manage so many things.\nBut I\u2019ll not go insane because\nI enjoy being alive.\nActivity is...\nAnything is okay.\nEverything I do, I enjoy (Both laugh).\nSmall things, big things, every kind of thing.\nMost profound things and silly things, I enjoy thoroughly (Both laugh) (Applause).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): As should us all.\nLastly, in a biopic made on you, who would play you (Laughter)?\nSadhguru: But who would make a biopic, first of all (Laughter)?\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): No, there would be lots of interested people.\nSadhguru: Maybe you should animate (Laughter).\nInterviewer (Karan Johar): I don\u2019t think you would want that (Both laugh).\nWell, that is the end of the rapid fire\nand you totally deserve the hamper that doesn\u2019t exist on this platform (Laughter).\nBut it\u2019s a virtual hamper that I\u2019ve given to you\nwith my (Both laugh) love, gratitude and deepest amount of respect.\nThank you (Both laugh) (Applause).
