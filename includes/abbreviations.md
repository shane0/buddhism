*[EMPTY_NATURE]:   All phenomena, including the perceived "self, are empty in nature, which means they are without independent existence or inherent, fixed characteristics; they are impermanent, mutable, and interdependent; their individuality is in appearance and conception only.  For example, the Buddhist classifications of phenomena, the five skandhas, the twelve bases, and the eighteen domains, describe how ordinary people perceive the world. Based on ignorance, we then recognize these perceptions as having a real existence. However, with prajna, we will see that even these Buddhist constructions are ultimately empty in nature.

*[no form, feeling ... or consciousness]:  This negation of the five skandhas is to point out that the appearance and character of beings with which we are familiar actually have no intrinsic substance.  Form (physical matter) is energy; its appearance is an illusion arising from conditions. Feelings are subjective; conceptions are mind-made; volition (will or intent which leads to action) and consciousness are streams of thoughts based on deluded understanding of reality. There is no substantial identity or "self" to be found in form, feeling, conception, volition, or consciousness.

*[NO_IGNORANCE__NO_ENDING_OF_AGING_AND_DEATH]: The twelve links of interdependence   explains the process of the rebirth cycle ignorance - intentional action- consciousness-- mind and form-- six senses-- contact-- feeling-- craving-- grasping-- being birth- old age and death. However, from the view of absolute reality, the twelve links and their elimination (ending of ignorance...), which is needed to gain liberation from rebirth, are also empty. In fact, what we perceive as birth and death are delusions, so the nature of suffering is also empty.
*[NO_SUFFERING__NO_CAUSE__NO_EXTINCTION__NO_PATH]: Since suffering is produced by ignorance and delusion, it is empty. The emptiness of suffering, cause of suffering, extinction of suffering, and the path is a higher understanding of the Four Noble Truths.
