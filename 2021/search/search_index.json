<p>deepening insight understanding</p> <p>knowledge and they're all bound into one</p> <p>wisdom and skillful means you could say</p> <p>and that's been enormously can tell me</p> <p>for me so you went to India basically in</p> <p>search of meaning you had facts from the</p> <p>science side of things so you're looking</p> <p>for meaning but then you end up coming</p> <p>back to the states and where do you go</p> <p>you end up at em who are studying</p> <p>physics is that right well back when I</p> <p>was supposed to be there for an academic</p> <p>year wound up dropping all my classes</p> <p>that I was intending to do struck terror</p> <p>in the hearts of my parents give me that</p> <p>oh it's throwing away my entire future</p> <p>which of course I did but I read</p> <p>voraciously for that I basically became</p> <p>a hermit for nine months and just read</p> <p>voraciously and then wind up dropping</p> <p>all my classes except for Tibetan</p> <p>language because I figured this is my</p> <p>path and in 1970 there were very few</p> <p>people who are bilingual so if I was</p> <p>serious about this and I was then I've</p> <p>got to learn how to read and speak</p> <p>Tibetan so that's all I did and then</p> <p>read voraciously and you asked about</p> <p>when I started reading I started</p> <p>practicing meditation I started TM</p> <p>Transcendental Meditation a year or two</p> <p>earlier</p> <p>and I was good but I wanted it more and</p> <p>I picked up a marvelous book and it's</p> <p>the heart of Buddhist meditation by</p> <p>nanoparticle Tara outstanding German</p> <p>scholar it was trained for years I met</p> <p>him years later in 1980 it's an</p> <p>outstanding it's still a classic and it</p> <p>covers the mahasabha Pat Tomasulo an</p> <p>excellent commentary to it I read that</p> <p>and it just read on my own I had no</p> <p>teacher but I thought I can practice</p> <p>that this really makes sense and it was</p> <p>not just meaning if somebody wanted</p> <p>meaning I could have maybe tried to just</p> <p>adopt some aberrant form of Christianity</p> <p>and you know be a good heretical</p> <p>Christian but I was looking for insight</p> <p>for understanding for knowledge and here</p> <p>the satipatthana sutra decided a ton of</p> <p>practice before our closed applications</p> <p>of mindfulness that's just that in</p> <p>is that is it's tremendously meaningful</p> <p>and yet it's so smart it's so sharp it's</p> <p>intelligent it's radically empirical and</p> <p>so I immerse myself and started</p> <p>practicing that in 1970 on my own in</p> <p>Germany and then bought myself a one-way</p> <p>ticket to India and so then when you</p> <p>came back and started at Amherst I'm</p> <p>wondering what was the thought why why</p> <p>after spending four years in Dharamsala</p> <p>you know meeting all these llamas I</p> <p>think I get you up tonight he's on insta</p> <p>llama and then you come back and then</p> <p>there's this pull back into academia and</p> <p>I was wondering what would the</p> <p>motivation behind that was sure well it</p> <p>was more than four years I was in</p> <p>Dharamsala from 71 to 75 had tremendous</p> <p>and repeated health problems one after</p> <p>another three cases of hepatitis I think</p> <p>I got typhoid I had three types of worms</p> <p>the list goes on and on it was</p> <p>physically very very tough and mentally</p> <p>and spiritually just a feast I mean it</p> <p>was terrific but also really took a lot</p> <p>of wear and tear on the body and then by</p> <p>that time that by 1971 I had a personal</p> <p>connection with His Holiness Dalai Lama</p> <p>he was my husband is and will be my root</p> <p>guru since 71 and so after been there</p> <p>and I was I received my four-nation from</p> <p>him since 1975 just a few months after</p> <p>my ordination with him full ordination</p> <p>then I met with him because my teacher</p> <p>who gave me my novice ordination two</p> <p>years earlier had been posted to become</p> <p>abbot of the monastery the Recon</p> <p>monastery and journey in Switzerland and</p> <p>again my second home so I met with him</p> <p>and and just simply simply asked him</p> <p>where can I be of greatest benefit shall</p> <p>I stay here in Dharamsala continue</p> <p>meditating and so on</p> <p>I toured also spent more than a year in</p> <p>the Buddhist school dialectics so it had</p> <p>fairly rigorous training there so I</p> <p>should shall I stay here in Dharamsala</p> <p>or shall I accompany my teacher back to</p> <p>Switzerland by then I was fluent in</p> <p>Tibetan my kid services interpreter</p> <p>continued my own training and to</p> <p>whatever is helpful and he said go west</p> <p>young man</p> <p>and so in 1975 then I went back to</p> <p>Switzerland spent four and a half years</p> <p>there a translating for him eventually I</p> <p>was teaching I was translating writing</p> <p>practicing</p> <p>after about nine or ten years by the</p> <p>time I got to the end of the 70s it</p> <p>would been had been pretty intensive</p> <p>training lots and lots of teaching</p> <p>including a good dose of tera vaada</p> <p>which I received from one monk who came</p> <p>to dance alone I study with him</p> <p>intensely for a summer maybe a bit more</p> <p>but then after night by the United end</p> <p>of 1979 I just felt kind of saturated</p> <p>with undigested knowledge but not that</p> <p>I'd understood but not assimilated so I</p> <p>wrote to his holiness and said all I</p> <p>want to do now is meditate for a while</p> <p>and where shall I go shall I go back to</p> <p>America stay in Switzerland to come back</p> <p>to India and he said come to Mindy I'll</p> <p>teach you I'll teach you meditation I</p> <p>didn't take long to decide what to do</p> <p>and so I spent the next four years from</p> <p>beginning of 1984 through three end of</p> <p>1983 basically just in a series of</p> <p>meditative retreats in India Sri Lanka</p> <p>Insight Meditation Society right here in</p> <p>Boston you are outside of Boston Manor</p> <p>and living in the breakers out in</p> <p>Arizona and so on for years than just</p> <p>just meditating and by that time I had</p> <p>really been out of the mainstream of</p> <p>Western civilization for thirteen years</p> <p>and I would often say not really ingest</p> <p>but I was born at the age of 20 I just</p> <p>flew in like with my pals in Hindi or</p> <p>Switzerland so forth I would say I was</p> <p>born at the age of 20 because that's the</p> <p>the age at which things started making</p> <p>sense and before that first 20 years was</p> <p>a drumroll to actually having in a</p> <p>beginning when I thought was a</p> <p>meaningful life but by the time I was</p> <p>2033 almost 34 then I just thought I</p> <p>went to Asia and I immersed myself in</p> <p>Tibetan culture and primarily in</p> <p>buddhadharma to seek integration to live</p> <p>a whole and meaningful and truthful life</p> <p>integrating meaning and wisdom insight</p> <p>knowledge and what I done in the process</p> <p>is completely bifurcate myself into the</p> <p>first twenty years in the last 14 and</p> <p>had alienated myself from my own culture</p> <p>so I felt a stranger in my own home and</p> <p>completely doesn't continue my Western</p> <p>education and I thought well maybe now</p> <p>after 14 years of quite thorough</p> <p>immersion in a very different culture</p> <p>and whole spiritual tradition</p> <p>maybe it's time to integrate to begin</p> <p>integrating and so I was accepted at</p> <p>Amherst College to wish I was there an</p> <p>enormous privilege it's an outstanding</p> <p>college and that was in 84 and decided</p> <p>to study physics because I've have</p> <p>thought here here's the paradigm here's</p> <p>the here's the the template for Western</p> <p>Sciences the whole Galileo started it</p> <p>and all the other branches of science</p> <p>suffer from physics Envy I've been told</p> <p>you know emulating this tremendous</p> <p>success story of physics going back to</p> <p>Copernicus Kepler Galileo Newton and on</p> <p>there is science at its most dazzling</p> <p>one can say from my perspective and so</p> <p>why not study that you know and then and</p> <p>do all the hard work does that do the</p> <p>mathematics do from classical mechanics</p> <p>and electromagnetism all the way through</p> <p>but what I was really curious about was</p> <p>quantum mechanics and so I thought if</p> <p>there's going to be some real meaningful</p> <p>engagement between modern physics and</p> <p>the Buddhist tradition which I get I've</p> <p>been trained by them for 14 years I</p> <p>thought it's gonna be here quantum</p> <p>mechanics because this is now</p> <p>challenging a lot of the absolutes that</p> <p>pervaded classical physics absolute</p> <p>space time matter energy so I won't</p> <p>elaborate in quantum mechanics but I was</p> <p>very intrigued and so that's what I did</p> <p>Adam Martin a marvelous mentor one was</p> <p>named I'm glad to mention Arthur Zions</p> <p>he remains one of my dearest friends and</p> <p>he really took me under his wing he</p> <p>guided me through my training and</p> <p>history of physics philosophy of science</p> <p>quantum mechanics and with Bob Thurman</p> <p>I studied Sanskrit and I wrote a 500</p> <p>page thesis and left a very happy camper</p> <p>how old are you at this stage 36 when I</p> <p>graduate Wow so you fit so much in</p> <p>already and and at that time you were</p> <p>studying you were still I think you were</p> <p>still you know getting teachings I think</p> <p>you've met up with Ganley marimba and</p> <p>you were also going out to the</p> <p>California desert and doing retreats and</p> <p>all this all these kind of things and so</p> <p>I'm wondering I was wondering</p> <p>particularly about Ganley marimba and</p> <p>he's rumored to have a Qi</p> <p>chanita and I was wondering if where</p> <p>your interest in geometry practice came</p> <p>from and whether he was an influence on</p> <p>you in that regard</p> <p>yeah so during my years two-and-a-half</p> <p>years yet Amherst</p> <p>they gave me two semesters and I was</p> <p>writing a very big thesis why asking for</p> <p>one more semester because I was full</p> <p>scholarship I came out without that</p> <p>without debt which is enormous</p> <p>I have enormous gratitude for Emmer's</p> <p>for that so I spent five semesters there</p> <p>and during that time I was still</p> <p>ordained I was a monk so as a Buddhist</p> <p>monk studying physics mathematics</p> <p>history of science philosophy of science</p> <p>but an incognito monk and then when I</p> <p>graduated all I wanted to do is go off</p> <p>into retreating him so I went slipped</p> <p>off to the Eastern Sierra the high</p> <p>desert of the Eastern Sierra Nevada</p> <p>mountains in California and was there</p> <p>for about a year and in the meantime</p> <p>back in 1980 when I when a solon is</p> <p>invited me back to India to meditate I</p> <p>was given by a truly marvelous Tibetan</p> <p>yogi by the name again Shama wanted old</p> <p>friends with lama zopa rinpoche and I</p> <p>remember so forth again Shama Wondrich</p> <p>was a yogi yogi and he moved into gates</p> <p>or uplands empty cabin left his cabin</p> <p>vacant so he invited me to do my retreat</p> <p>in his cabin and so at that time one of</p> <p>the Yogi's Tibetan Yogi's living at</p> <p>there about an hour and a half hike</p> <p>above McLeod Ganj about Dharamsala one</p> <p>of the Yogi's living up there was gama</p> <p>marimba and he allowed me to come and</p> <p>drop in on him once a week just for me</p> <p>to consult with him about my practice</p> <p>his holiness with guiding my practice</p> <p>but he had a few other things to do with</p> <p>his time besides guide me so I couldn't</p> <p>just drop in on him whenever I wanted to</p> <p>is given I'm River was more available so</p> <p>I would see his holiness whenever I</p> <p>could began my remember I got to know</p> <p>quite well and developed a real</p> <p>friendship with him at a very deep sense</p> <p>of reverence and respect it's just a</p> <p>tremendous you'll be a wonderful monk</p> <p>scholar and contemplative so we got to</p> <p>know each other that way and then after</p> <p>I'd finished up at Amherst and that was</p> <p>in 86 then with a bit of preparation and</p> <p>I asked His Holiness</p> <p>whether he would allow Gemma if young</p> <p>member of wish to come whether he be</p> <p>willing to come and lead a one-year</p> <p>shamah to retreat a group retreat</p> <p>because I've been teaching in Seattle</p> <p>for some time at that point and aroused</p> <p>a certain amount of interest in this and</p> <p>he consulted with His Holiness his own</p> <p>and has told him yes it would be good</p> <p>idea to come so he came for all of 1970</p> <p>1988 1988 he led and I was kind of his</p> <p>apprentice a one-year shamah to retreat</p> <p>for 12 people and it went very very well</p> <p>everybody in the retreat said it was the</p> <p>most meaningful year of their lives but</p> <p>in terms of mine in the first teacher</p> <p>the first Lama from whom I received</p> <p>sustained and very rigorous training was</p> <p>cashing home anti-gay because I went to</p> <p>Dharma Zala expressly because under the</p> <p>auspices of His Holiness Dalai Lama the</p> <p>Tibetan works the Tibetan light come</p> <p>library of Tibetan worked in archives</p> <p>had just opened the doors and they were</p> <p>they held a one-year course in Buddhism</p> <p>and so I went from Switzerland to to</p> <p>Dharamsala because of that course I was</p> <p>studying with a sakya lama in</p> <p>Switzerland and I wanted to go to Nepal</p> <p>and find a cave with some yogi in it</p> <p>they take one look at me and say my</p> <p>chela my chela you know leading me to</p> <p>enlightenment</p> <p>but this bulletin came from Dharamsala</p> <p>and my sakya lama in switzerland said go</p> <p>there so I just made a beeline there but</p> <p>caching anti-gay when he was teaching he</p> <p>taught all of lamrim I taught the guide</p> <p>to the Bodhisattva way of life he also</p> <p>taught the abyss AMA alankara or the</p> <p>ornament for the Ottoman for clear</p> <p>realization and in all of these</p> <p>teachings including shantideva shaman is</p> <p>there I mean it's very explicitly there</p> <p>and I remember very vividly I don't want</p> <p>to go on too long here I remember very</p> <p>vividly when again when getting on Tiger</p> <p>we're teaching Islam remain you got to</p> <p>the schemata just before the passion of</p> <p>course he said well why don't we</p> <p>practice a little bit</p> <p>he'd be teaching as you know the by the</p> <p>book and then he said well let's</p> <p>practice of it so there's just eight of</p> <p>us and this one year of course and so</p> <p>he's so I'm up for it you know so we sat</p> <p>there and he sat like there's like a</p> <p>stone Buddha and after 20 minutes I and</p> <p>I think the others in our class were</p> <p>getting getting fidgety and</p> <p>uncomfortable and half an hour goes by</p> <p>getting more uncomfortable an hour wind</p> <p>by he's not moving a muscle and then</p> <p>we're in physic</p> <p>agony and two hours goes by and three</p> <p>hours go by by that time we're basically</p> <p>internally scream our heads off were so</p> <p>much pain and then in a gift moment I</p> <p>get gently opened his eyes look at us</p> <p>and said Shawn that is not so easy so</p> <p>but he said many things that really</p> <p>captured my attention he said you know</p> <p>if you've achieved summer to them the</p> <p>passion is easy and when he was teaching</p> <p>us the abysm alankara this definitive</p> <p>presentation of the five paths starting</p> <p>with the path of accumulation</p> <p>culminating associate rock our Heartland</p> <p>by the Sante path as a buddha according</p> <p>to the lineage in which he was trained</p> <p>which I received if you want to reach</p> <p>just the first path well the the crucial</p> <p>element is you so deeply cultivate</p> <p>bodhichitta that arises spontaneously</p> <p>effortlessly but for that to happen your</p> <p>mind has to be wonderfully stable fit</p> <p>free of the by Box curations and for</p> <p>that you have to achieve schemata</p> <p>achieve shaman not just work at it but</p> <p>you should have achieved schemata which</p> <p>indicates a very very exceptional degree</p> <p>of mental health and balance and with</p> <p>that basis you cultivate bodhichitta to</p> <p>the point that there rises spontaneously</p> <p>and then you reach the path and so I</p> <p>listen to that mr. boat that's the most</p> <p>important thing to do and it was</p> <p>actually oddly enough it was a reason</p> <p>for me leaving after about a year and a</p> <p>half my formal monastic training was on</p> <p>the track to becoming a Geisha because</p> <p>I'd receive all the basic training and</p> <p>logic and debate and Buddhist psychology</p> <p>and and so forth and we are just about</p> <p>to begin</p> <p>six years of training six years</p> <p>continuously of the other semi alankara</p> <p>which we'd exhaustively in detail study</p> <p>the five Madiga as if I've passed the</p> <p>1000 Bodhisattva Bloomie's but there</p> <p>came a little interference on this</p> <p>trajectory and that is who inca the wink</p> <p>at the burmese meditation master he was</p> <p>invited to Dharamsala to lead his 10-day</p> <p>retreat and his holiness told all of us</p> <p>in a monastery we should all go and so</p> <p>well then you go your route Lama I just</p> <p>said go so it and so there I was in</p> <p>going cos we treat starting it like for</p> <p>in the morning meditating 11 hours a day</p> <p>and in in these 10 days I looked at my</p> <p>mind and it was like an enormous garbage</p> <p>dump that was alive with living garbage</p> <p>you know just so much noise and</p> <p>agitation and imbalances and so forth</p> <p>and I looked at this and after about</p> <p>eight or nine days of this I said what</p> <p>would I be doing studying the five paths</p> <p>and the ten are you put us after boonies</p> <p>when I can't even see the bottom edge of</p> <p>the lowest path because I'm Way down</p> <p>here and so why don't I just drew</p> <p>everything I possibly can to try to</p> <p>reach the first path but this means I</p> <p>don't need detailed knowledge of the</p> <p>five paths and the ten boomys I just</p> <p>need to learn how to become a bit saner</p> <p>so with His Holiness permission I</p> <p>dropped out and once again I drop out</p> <p>dropped out of Western a key to me and I</p> <p>dropped out of eastern academia and just</p> <p>often meditated it's all I wanted to do</p> <p>and then so that was so that led to four</p> <p>years of retreat from 80 to 84 and then</p> <p>gallim Rimba came in 1988 and then he</p> <p>caught the Shama to a retreat and it</p> <p>just struck me ever since that this is</p> <p>something that is universally important</p> <p>in Buddhism Theravada but and perfectly</p> <p>clear and in any school of Buddhist you</p> <p>have Sheila Samadhi flat yeah you can't</p> <p>skip Samadhi</p> <p>don't blow it off a momentary samadhi</p> <p>that's a gimmick Samadhi is more among</p> <p>more than just a little momentary</p> <p>business it's something quite serious</p> <p>and in the - in the my Anna and the vaad</p> <p>Rihanna everywhere Sean that is</p> <p>everywhere cropping up and yet to my</p> <p>astonishment as the years went by is</p> <p>seen that it was either overlooked</p> <p>marginalized or tore trivialized and so</p> <p>it just struck me this is a missing</p> <p>piece so many things are talking well</p> <p>really well in the Terracotta tradition</p> <p>the charm is in all schools in Tibetan</p> <p>Buddhism many outstanding teachers and</p> <p>many outstanding teachings and and of</p> <p>course a number of people teach</p> <p>summative but not that many really</p> <p>emphasize it and so I can be taking that</p> <p>to heart</p> <p>so after hearing that I can't help but</p> <p>ask a technical question well you're</p> <p>talking about geometry and bodhichitta</p> <p>and I'm wondering if you think that you</p> <p>have to it's necessary to achieve Shama</p> <p>table before you can achieve bodhichitta</p> <p>yeah the whole notion of achieving</p> <p>bodhichitta by you as a scholar you know</p> <p>this is referring to in the benjamin my</p> <p>and hngg sam uncontrived effortless</p> <p>spontaneously arising bodhichitta such</p> <p>you've cultivated so deeply that it's</p> <p>your more your default mode your ground</p> <p>state and it could be actively triggered</p> <p>by virtually anything and then just</p> <p>Bowditch it is there you know it's a</p> <p>primary mind it's not just an aspiration</p> <p>have once in a while it's like your</p> <p>prime directive and when that sinks so</p> <p>deeply into your psyche almost into your</p> <p>marrow</p> <p>that it's just your your desire of</p> <p>desires for which all other desires are</p> <p>derivative that's when you've achieved</p> <p>bodhichitta and then at that point</p> <p>you're a Buddhist actor so is it</p> <p>necessary to have fully achieved siya</p> <p>matter and by that I mean technically</p> <p>then access to the first jhana because</p> <p>that's that's how the term is used in in</p> <p>the whole intro Tibetan tradition there</p> <p>is scholarly debate on this point in the</p> <p>tradition of getting on Tiger Lama Zopa</p> <p>Rinpoche issue wrapped in the set at the</p> <p>ceviche tradition they say yeah you need</p> <p>to fully achieve da Matta in order to</p> <p>bring about that depth and that degree</p> <p>of spontaneity bodhichitta but other</p> <p>very well very erudite scholars say not</p> <p>entire you don't need to achieve all</p> <p>nine stages you certainly must have a</p> <p>stable mind certainly the five</p> <p>obscurations must be attenuated their</p> <p>beings kind of craving central craving</p> <p>laxity and excitation like laxity and</p> <p>dullness excitation and anxiety and</p> <p>afflictive afflictive uncertainty I</p> <p>think I just and they'll will enmity so</p> <p>those five have to be really in abeyance</p> <p>it's hard to imagine a mind that is very</p> <p>prone to ill-will and animosity in that</p> <p>same mind stream but it's just arising</p> <p>that's kind of like that's not gonna</p> <p>happen</p> <p>so there's scholarly debate whether you</p> <p>need simply a very good degree of</p> <p>Samadhi I mean really good like I'm nine</p> <p>stages leading to schemata okay Stage</p> <p>five given I'm Reba said he told me with</p> <p>doing that one year that I lived with</p> <p>him in 1988 during this one year retreat</p> <p>he said it was not uncommon in the</p> <p>gloopy tradition for very serious Yogi's</p> <p>like himself in terms of schemata just</p> <p>to go up to the fifth</p> <p>out of nine stages sending Appa the</p> <p>fifth of nine stages at that point your</p> <p>course excitation is is through you can</p> <p>sit for an hour maybe longer with an</p> <p>unbroken flow of mindfulness never</p> <p>completely disengaging for a meditative</p> <p>object the mind has reason to be clear</p> <p>you're somebody's pretty darn good and</p> <p>he said it was common in his tradition</p> <p>the glue per tradition to achieve that</p> <p>as a flat Shama to practice focusing on</p> <p>an image of buddha shakyamuni or</p> <p>whatever method you like and then with</p> <p>that degree of samadhi then go right</p> <p>into state regeneration practice and</p> <p>then finish off what you started with in</p> <p>the context of stage of generation</p> <p>practice but in as a point of fact and</p> <p>some couple points this out jujube Ling</p> <p>pointed out the great name a llama llama</p> <p>meet Pomona birch a point out they've</p> <p>all said from the fifteenth century</p> <p>until the present relatively few people</p> <p>actually fully achieve summit most of</p> <p>them seem to be in a hurry well achieve</p> <p>a little bit and then Rob the state</p> <p>regeneration or just do a lamb rim or 13</p> <p>do more they're doing so to Norma mudra</p> <p>they're eager to get to the good stuff</p> <p>and summit is like thinking about summit</p> <p>Hindus do summit how important could</p> <p>that be you know that of sectarian bias</p> <p>comes in or the Indiana they do schemata</p> <p>how come born exactly you know but</p> <p>that's a sectarian talk it is enormous</p> <p>Lee important and there's there's a</p> <p>story from Buddha's own life after he</p> <p>had finished his six years of aesthetic</p> <p>practices damaged his health restored</p> <p>his health and in might recall from the</p> <p>nakaya's then then the Buddha was the</p> <p>gautuma the age of 35 was wondering what</p> <p>now because he had already tried Samadhi</p> <p>tried all these ascetic practices and so</p> <p>forth and then he recalled a time as a</p> <p>youth maybe is 12 13 years old something</p> <p>like that where he was simply sitting</p> <p>quietly under a rose apple tree while</p> <p>his father was out doing some ritual and</p> <p>a royal ritual and he spontaneously</p> <p>slipped into the first Jana just slip</p> <p>right into it since it was drew the 5ox</p> <p>creation went down the mine whose supple</p> <p>it was filled with well-being was his</p> <p>sense of what bliss and so forth and</p> <p>most importantly release fit for action</p> <p>you know supple</p> <p>ha that scent that Sanskrit term</p> <p>supplements malleability and then as</p> <p>it's that cropped up spontaneously then</p> <p>when the Risha was over he had to get on</p> <p>with his life then it also subsided he</p> <p>got it that it was just a taste and but</p> <p>he recalled the age of 35 he recalled</p> <p>that that first jhana and it and then</p> <p>the thought arose in his mind he said</p> <p>the thought arose in my mind might that</p> <p>be the way to enlightenment and then</p> <p>answer came back yes so then in a</p> <p>relatively short time he reassures jhana</p> <p>and then on that basis its history</p> <p>achieved perfect enlightenment but he</p> <p>himself indicated in that statement the</p> <p>first jhana it's all it's very good to</p> <p>achieve more but that one I think</p> <p>there's pretty I think among really</p> <p>knowledgeable scholars like Kim in</p> <p>doTERRA now standing tera vaada scholar</p> <p>and very widely accepted in the Indo</p> <p>Tibetan tradition that degree this</p> <p>access to the first jhana or the full</p> <p>first jhana these are indispensable to</p> <p>really proceed along the path to become</p> <p>a sonnet on this Roddick Ayana to become</p> <p>a stream enter and so forth and on the</p> <p>my on a path to become a bodhisattva and</p> <p>proceed on the Bodhisattva path this is</p> <p>this is the kind of the the gold</p> <p>standard of what I would call mental</p> <p>health and balance and you need an</p> <p>exceptional degree because if a person</p> <p>is not just about of course stress</p> <p>reduction or gaining an insight here or</p> <p>there but Vibhishana in union with a</p> <p>passion with sha meta which is the</p> <p>Buddhist great innovation that had never</p> <p>been taught I think in the tradition of</p> <p>the Indian contemplative heritage</p> <p>prior to the Buddha was a great</p> <p>innovation it is that combination of</p> <p>schemata and the passion that has the</p> <p>power to completely eradicate mental</p> <p>afflictions from the root so that really</p> <p>caught my attention early on and I just</p> <p>felt you can't skip sha meta or you can</p> <p>but then none of your other practices</p> <p>will come to full fruition I like to</p> <p>fast forward a little bit to you meeting</p> <p>Giotto Rinpoche and coming into contact</p> <p>with those oak chain teachings again</p> <p>because you know back if there Evans</p> <p>whence this book you you it started your</p> <p>path yeah</p> <p>and I was wondering if you could speak a</p> <p>little bit with you know your earlier</p> <p>training was always Galaga in tsongkhapa</p> <p>and I was wondering how you integrated</p> <p>your earlier training in the global</p> <p>image with the Zoltan teachings if you</p> <p>could just speak a little bit to that</p> <p>sure I'll try to be concise which all my</p> <p>students learn terrible yeah I was my</p> <p>initial inspiration to follow the path</p> <p>of Tibetan Buddhism or into Tibetan</p> <p>Buddhism was this book on zouk Chen but</p> <p>then circumstances simply unfolded in</p> <p>such a way that I had really no access</p> <p>to zou Chen teachings for 20 years it</p> <p>was there and I was immensely nourished</p> <p>both in terms of growth of understanding</p> <p>and knowledge and also an</p> <p>ever-increasing sense of meaning through</p> <p>those 20 years I I wouldn't give away</p> <p>one year of it it was 20 years very well</p> <p>spent and and by the time I was 90 next</p> <p>I was 90 19 1990 don't tell how early by</p> <p>the time of 1990s always 40 years old</p> <p>I think Plato said that's when you when</p> <p>you're allowed to start start studying</p> <p>philosophy at the age of 40 I think he</p> <p>said so I had 40 years under my belt and</p> <p>one of my oldest and dearest Dharma</p> <p>friends is a woman named Sangha Kondo</p> <p>it's a very accomplished translator</p> <p>teacher really an outstanding person and</p> <p>would be with we've been buddies since</p> <p>1972 or so way back and so we kept in</p> <p>touch just in a very nice friendship and</p> <p>she early on the years and years before</p> <p>1990 she become very close disciple and</p> <p>an interpreter for gateau de mogi so I</p> <p>would drop in on her once in a while and</p> <p>I meet her Lama we would get to know him</p> <p>a little bit checking him out you know</p> <p>and then in 1990 by that time I had</p> <p>spent a couple of years in retreat out</p> <p>of academia and decided to continue my</p> <p>education so when I matriculated at</p> <p>Stanford in the in the ph.d program in</p> <p>religious studies and so I was living</p> <p>there in the Bay Area but really knowing</p> <p>that if I stayed only in academia it</p> <p>would be quite arid from my perspective</p> <p>lots of fact and not a whole lot of</p> <p>meaning in the methodology you know</p> <p>because it's just radically not Orion</p> <p>it's practice keep the objective stance</p> <p>which means stand outside up and don't</p> <p>go native whereas I was obviously I was</p> <p>already a lost cause I was native</p> <p>already and so yeah Jenna but you're</p> <p>very happily decided to move down from</p> <p>Oregon for a while to the Bay Area and</p> <p>so he gave some teachings on dream yoga</p> <p>in 1999 gioconda was translating he gave</p> <p>it in San Jose and I'd received</p> <p>teachings on dream yoga from the sole</p> <p>member jayx a great very great galloper</p> <p>Lama back in 1978 in Switzerland I</p> <p>served as his interpreter for all the</p> <p>six yoga's of Naropa so I had some</p> <p>acquaintances but Keyshia Dobson who</p> <p>organized this invited him to give us</p> <p>his teachings he totally just flat out I</p> <p>want you to receive these teachings now</p> <p>but it's over your head you know just</p> <p>get the imprints now but don't think</p> <p>about practice you're not ready yet so</p> <p>that was now 12 years later guttered</p> <p>which is teaching dream younger but he's</p> <p>teaching it like you can really practice</p> <p>this you're teaching it experientially</p> <p>and in this kind of this men mapped mode</p> <p>this mode of pith instructions there's</p> <p>nothing academic about it and I just</p> <p>drank it in like nectar and so it was</p> <p>just a very strong connection I said</p> <p>okay this this is a person I'd love to</p> <p>read you know how does one of my long</p> <p>lines and so as it turns out just a</p> <p>marvelous opportunity arose up for me</p> <p>for the next seven years from 1990</p> <p>through 97 I want to being his his</p> <p>primary interpreter he's living in the</p> <p>Bay Area Sangre Honda was up in Oregon</p> <p>so various circumstances came together</p> <p>so I had the just priceless opportunity</p> <p>to serve as his interpreter for the last</p> <p>two years I was living with him</p> <p>just a little cottage across from his</p> <p>and so he gave those teachings on you</p> <p>canto translating and then not too long</p> <p>after that he had been invited down to</p> <p>the Shambhala Center in Hollywood and he</p> <p>said Alan I'd like you to come down and</p> <p>translate for me I said sure glad to</p> <p>honored so he came down to the Shambhala</p> <p>center and he was 1990-1991 motel ago</p> <p>and he picked out two chapters from a</p> <p>great text on the Union of Muhammad</p> <p>Renzo Chen by Camacho net which hasn't</p> <p>been translated it's certainly called</p> <p>the Delta TM the great commentary and he</p> <p>picked out two chapters within the</p> <p>Mohammed results in tradition schemata</p> <p>and her passion</p> <p>and that's how he started me off so I</p> <p>was getting shamaton you know all the</p> <p>way through remember every teacher</p> <p>really and it was just breathtaking and</p> <p>seeing well here was this smooth segue</p> <p>because guess you're traveling back in</p> <p>1976 had taught us and I was</p> <p>interpreting for him pensioner punches</p> <p>text his route text and commentary on my</p> <p>mudra so and it just enchanted me I</p> <p>really drew me so during my four years</p> <p>of solitary practice I went a lot in</p> <p>that direction and now yeah Tran watch</p> <p>is teaching it from the union of the</p> <p>kagu and yingwan traditions whereas I</p> <p>had it from the Union of the guide you</p> <p>and galloper tradition so it's this</p> <p>seamless transition and so he taught</p> <p>those and it was just like I was just</p> <p>thrilled I mean literally I was thrilled</p> <p>and so he continues staying on there in</p> <p>the Bay Area and then he just taught one</p> <p>text after another and every single one</p> <p>of them a spacious path to freedom</p> <p>make it awareness natural liberation</p> <p>badness mother's teaching of the six</p> <p>bardos he taught a short text by Zhu</p> <p>Jian member jenshaw Madiba pacchiana he</p> <p>taught the Vajra essence every single</p> <p>text that he taught while during those</p> <p>seven years that I was translating for</p> <p>him every single one emphasized the</p> <p>enormous importance of Muruga of path</p> <p>we're here to not just practice Dharma</p> <p>but to reach the path and move along the</p> <p>path the fourth noble truth after all</p> <p>and every single one of them emphasized</p> <p>shammed so I had this from every side</p> <p>and so he has just been my like my</p> <p>spiritual father and my primary so chin</p> <p>Oh chin Lama and the teachings that he's</p> <p>passed on to me and authorized me to</p> <p>pass on to others is just it's a Philip</p> <p>fulfillment of my heart's desire but</p> <p>happily my root Lama of course is his</p> <p>old mentor Dalai Lama and of all the</p> <p>galoop Obama's that he is largely a</p> <p>kalapa Lama he more than any other I</p> <p>know with no comparison completely</p> <p>integrates the teachings ons auction</p> <p>which you receive from Tengu cancer</p> <p>temperature and other great Enuma Lamas</p> <p>and his whole his whole formidable good</p> <p>look the background and I received on</p> <p>multiple occasions ochen teachings from</p> <p>him and so he made it very easy for me</p> <p>here's you know the Lama of Lamas as far</p> <p>as I'm concerned and seamlessly</p> <p>integrating these and that's what I've</p> <p>that's what I've sought to do for the</p> <p>last 26 years so it's been in no way an</p> <p>abandonment of my back</p> <p>tera vaada Ella for six months in sri</p> <p>lanka studied with inanimate raya</p> <p>formidable Sri Lankan teacher monk</p> <p>scholar he took me under his wing and</p> <p>trained me so it's in no way a</p> <p>disengagement for my tera vaada</p> <p>background legal oopah but rather it's</p> <p>the one translation of Zhou Chen is the</p> <p>great incumbent the great completion the</p> <p>great perfection are particularly good</p> <p>but there's ocean makes sense of all of</p> <p>the different paths and from my mind not</p> <p>only within Buddhism but actually it</p> <p>enables me to make sense of spiritual</p> <p>traditions outside of Buddhism and for</p> <p>that matter corner cosmology and certain</p> <p>elements of love science and philosophy</p> <p>of mind thank you so much my pleasure so</p> <p>I think we're gonna have about a five</p> <p>minute break and then Alan is going to</p> <p>come back and give us a short Dharma</p> <p>talk thank you well I'd like to go</p> <p>during these 20 minutes is to a very</p> <p>rich and concise excerpt from the Vajra</p> <p>essence which is a third of the three</p> <p>volumes here of Dijon lingas collected</p> <p>works arms of chen in which Padma Sam</p> <p>bhava by way of do gem Linga draws to my</p> <p>mind a marvelously clear distinction</p> <p>between what we call mind or chitta</p> <p>in Sanskrit and rickman were pristine</p> <p>awareness what's the difference between</p> <p>the two and I think he lays this out in</p> <p>a definitive extremely clear fashion but</p> <p>I'd like to build up to a little bit</p> <p>leave that for the grand finale and go</p> <p>back to excerpts from the text that for</p> <p>those of you who have followed the</p> <p>course on the foolish Dharma of an idiot</p> <p>clothed in madmen feathers one of the</p> <p>most concise of Digium lingas</p> <p>masterpieces really unsoaked chen just</p> <p>take a brief excerpt from that because</p> <p>he's talking about how you set out on</p> <p>the path of so chen</p> <p>what's the entry and i quote from a pure</p> <p>vision a visionary teaching that he</p> <p>received in which he's told in in a</p> <p>dream hey hey hue blind one who wished</p> <p>to enter the authentic path listen</p> <p>by authentic path that means a path that</p> <p>actually brings about irreversible</p> <p>purification transformation so you never</p> <p>fall back if it's not that it's not a</p> <p>path it's practicing Dharma it's being</p> <p>virtuous perhaps but a path means you're</p> <p>actually evolving irreversibly on the</p> <p>path of ever growing freedom and</p> <p>awakening and so those who wish to enter</p> <p>the authentic path listen the body is</p> <p>like a paper bag blown by the wind</p> <p>speech is like the sound of air passing</p> <p>through a pipe this mind is a creator of</p> <p>both samsara and Nirvana among these</p> <p>three identify which is primary you have</p> <p>a long time to wait before you'll see or</p> <p>hear something called meditation and so</p> <p>he's starting out with this emphasis</p> <p>this encouragement for us individually</p> <p>to investigate not just think about or</p> <p>rely upon other people Authority and so</p> <p>forth or simple logic but investigate</p> <p>experientially within our own continuum</p> <p>of being embodied human beings with</p> <p>minds and bodies and speech among these</p> <p>three ways of manifesting in the world</p> <p>body speech and mind often called the</p> <p>three doors which is primary and he</p> <p>really emphasizes in more than one I</p> <p>think perhaps all of his five major</p> <p>treatises on so Chen this is the first</p> <p>thing you've got to get right because if</p> <p>you're wobbly amorphous or you just</p> <p>flat-out wrong you'll not be able to</p> <p>enter this path because you're starting</p> <p>out with a fundamental fault hypothesis</p> <p>and everything will go screwy from that</p> <p>perspective and so of course in the Seok</p> <p>Jin view it is the mind that is primary</p> <p>speech is derivative and even body is</p> <p>derivative now this is an absolutely</p> <p>core theme it's not simply a required</p> <p>belief it's a truth that must be known</p> <p>where you decide on in this path if you</p> <p>sing something contrary that's fine you</p> <p>don't get punished for it but</p> <p>this path is not open to you and so this</p> <p>has though precedence all the way down</p> <p>to the most foundational teachings in</p> <p>the whole Buddhist tradition in the Pali</p> <p>Canon for example in the Samia ticket</p> <p>nakiya the Buddha states and I quote the</p> <p>world is led by the mind just generally</p> <p>in the universe mind is primary ok or</p> <p>the ever so often quoted first verse of</p> <p>the first chapter of the Dhammapada all</p> <p>phenomena are preceded by the mind issue</p> <p>forth from the mind and consist of the</p> <p>mind clearly that has multiple</p> <p>interpretations I don't mean to be</p> <p>always simplistic here but he said what</p> <p>he said and then we go to the Mahayana</p> <p>tradition to the one of the minor sutras</p> <p>that rathne mega sutra and here the</p> <p>buddha in the sutra states all phenomena</p> <p>are preceded by the mind when the mind</p> <p>is comprehended all phenomena are</p> <p>comprehended by bringing the mind under</p> <p>control all things are brought under</p> <p>control so this is a recurrent theme</p> <p>through all schools of Buddhism that the</p> <p>mind is primary when we address the</p> <p>first noble truth yes there's physical</p> <p>pain never to be marginalised but after</p> <p>all the deeper forms of suffering are</p> <p>not physical they're mental the</p> <p>suffering of change the suffering that</p> <p>goes with just the grasping to I am its</p> <p>mental suffering when you look at the</p> <p>second noble truth it's mental it's not</p> <p>brain it's not genetics if not</p> <p>environment it's not politics it's the</p> <p>mind it's your mental afflictions that</p> <p>are at the root of all suffering when</p> <p>you go to the third noble truth it's the</p> <p>mind that he/she is Nirvana not your</p> <p>body and you look at the fourth noble</p> <p>truth and it's all training of the mind</p> <p>certainly ethics has to do with body and</p> <p>speech but above all is the training of</p> <p>the mind so the entire framework of the</p> <p>Buddha Dharma is primarily emphasizing</p> <p>mind as primary and this is indicated in</p> <p>the Buddha's own night of his</p> <p>enlightenment when his first insight</p> <p>which he said I saw with direct</p> <p>perception was seeing countless of his</p> <p>own past lives he said I saw it with</p> <p>direct perception second watch of the</p> <p>night I watched countless past lives of</p> <p>other sentient beings and then he saw</p> <p>the interrelationship what we called the</p> <p>laws of karma the interrelationship that</p> <p>is not just scattered or stochastic</p> <p>random going from here to there</p> <p>but there's causality from former to</p> <p>later and so this is a starting insight</p> <p>it is necessary we're proceeding further</p> <p>on his auction path but it's also</p> <p>crucial they're enlightened eater in the</p> <p>Pali Canon the tera vaada all of my an</p> <p>olive Adrianna is there in Chan and in</p> <p>Zen and then we have the world view that</p> <p>we're very familiar with especially in a</p> <p>very educated city like Boston and</p> <p>Cambridge where if I can paraphrase a</p> <p>very common view nowadays all phenomena</p> <p>as in all experiences are preceded by</p> <p>the brain issue forth from the brain and</p> <p>consists of the brain but between the</p> <p>mind and the brain the brain is primary</p> <p>and in the immortal words of John John</p> <p>Searle and many others the mind is what</p> <p>the brain does and if you're having any</p> <p>kind of mental problem well it's</p> <p>basically a brain problem and so they</p> <p>turned it entirely on the head on his</p> <p>head and could not be more diametrically</p> <p>opposed so somebody is flamboyantly</p> <p>wrong and if we are objective and</p> <p>open-minded about this the Buddha</p> <p>himself was having basically a</p> <p>hallucinations on the might of at night</p> <p>of his enlightenment and Buddhism has</p> <p>basically been fundamentally psychotic</p> <p>ever since that's a logical possibility</p> <p>it is a logical possibility that they</p> <p>just you know it's pre-scientific is</p> <p>superstitious it's hocus pocus mumbo</p> <p>jumbo and claptrap I've heard all of</p> <p>these attributed to the Buddhist</p> <p>teachings that's a possibility or the</p> <p>other possibility is that for the last</p> <p>hundred and fifty years science has been</p> <p>profoundly led astray by the dogma of</p> <p>scientific materialism there's is it's</p> <p>it's a prelude to the juicy bit so you</p> <p>have to bear with me if you will you can</p> <p>back out in a minute there's a fella</p> <p>named Daniel Simpson I'm looking forward</p> <p>to meeting we've course founded back and</p> <p>forth he wrote a very provocative</p> <p>article called Buddhist meditation and</p> <p>cognitive sciences daniel simpson</p> <p>buddhist meditation cognitive sciences</p> <p>and find it online is worth reading he</p> <p>did a lot of good research and I quote</p> <p>him here he says one minor life</p> <p>scientist Richard Davidson was a very</p> <p>dear friend of mine a wonderful human</p> <p>being very bright scientist and just a</p> <p>very fine human being all together very</p> <p>good heart I've known him enough for 20</p> <p>more than 20 years</p> <p>one minor life scientists bridge</p> <p>Davidson has bent over backwards to</p> <p>avoid causing a fence while defending</p> <p>materialism he acknowledges being asked</p> <p>quote sharply but respectfully by the</p> <p>Dalai Lama to quote distinguished</p> <p>between that which has been empirically</p> <p>confirmed and that which is simply</p> <p>assumed and has become part of our</p> <p>conceptual theoretical and conceptual</p> <p>dogma</p> <p>so as Holland is kind of call them on</p> <p>the carpet so what do you guys really</p> <p>know which is backed by empirical</p> <p>evidence and what are you simply simply</p> <p>accepting out of pure site tradition</p> <p>theoretical and conceptual dogma so as</p> <p>holiness can be tough in a very</p> <p>benevolent respectful way but tough and</p> <p>so rigid he evidently commanded this and</p> <p>yet as as Daniel Simpson says yet he'd</p> <p>Richard Davidson feels obliged to note</p> <p>that quote certain scientific</p> <p>assumptions are themselves based on</p> <p>well-established principles adding says</p> <p>daniel simpson via the circum</p> <p>circumlocution some would say so Richard</p> <p>Davidson distanced herself a little bit</p> <p>from what he's about to say not much</p> <p>that the dependence of them of mind on</p> <p>brain is one such assumption that has</p> <p>been subjected to countless empirical</p> <p>tests and each and every one of them has</p> <p>provided support for this general claim</p> <p>so that would imply that some point in</p> <p>the past there was some really</p> <p>compelling physical evidence empirical</p> <p>evidence that showed that the mind and</p> <p>this refers to the whole bandwidth of</p> <p>states of consciousness that all of them</p> <p>are dependent on on the brain or to</p> <p>quote John Searle again the mind is what</p> <p>brain does the brain is primary in the</p> <p>mind is just what the brain does is a</p> <p>function that equality and epiphenomena</p> <p>of the brain so one would think well</p> <p>they do have some really strong</p> <p>empirical evidence for that</p> <p>unfortunately that's not true at all and</p> <p>so as much as I love Ritchie and</p> <p>respected in so many different ways this</p> <p>is a flamboyantly misleading statement</p> <p>that is ever since about 1963 when the</p> <p>term neuroscience was coined by a man</p> <p>named Schmidt Schmidt</p> <p>a biologist at MIT she coined the term</p> <p>and he and some of his contemporaries</p> <p>back in the early 60s</p> <p>they started the discipline they coined</p> <p>the term neuroscience and they started</p> <p>the discipline of neuroscience at MIT</p> <p>and the first college that actually had</p> <p>an undergraduate major in neuroscience</p> <p>was my alma mater Amherst College 1973</p> <p>but what was remarkable about the</p> <p>origins of modern neuroscience is this</p> <p>man Schmidt was trained as a biologist</p> <p>he had no training in philosophy of mind</p> <p>or psychology had no training in the</p> <p>mind at all he was trained only in</p> <p>chemistry biology physics and they</p> <p>simply he and his contemporaries fifty</p> <p>years ago simply decided that they would</p> <p>stop start using the term mind and brain</p> <p>interchangeably and act as if the</p> <p>mind-body problem had been solved they</p> <p>haven't even actually made any headway</p> <p>there was actually no evidence</p> <p>whatsoever that the mind is nothing more</p> <p>than a function of the brain they just</p> <p>started talking that way</p> <p>they just started talking as if the</p> <p>mind-body problem had been solved how</p> <p>the mind interacts with the brain and</p> <p>vice versa it had been somehow solved</p> <p>whereas it was more like church council</p> <p>just kinda citing a point of theology</p> <p>rather than a conclusion drawn on</p> <p>empirical evidence and what happened has</p> <p>happened over the last 50 years is a</p> <p>Society for Neuroscience which is the</p> <p>you know the Church Council of</p> <p>neuroscience they've simply decided that</p> <p>all of our scientific study of the brain</p> <p>will work with the assumption that the</p> <p>mind is the brain of the mind as a</p> <p>function of the brain and any other</p> <p>theory and any evidence that stands</p> <p>outside of that or challenges that we</p> <p>will ignore or ridicule and that's</p> <p>what's happened for the last 50 years we</p> <p>will ignore or ridicule any theory of</p> <p>the mind and the brain that is not</p> <p>materialistic I love science and I am</p> <p>deeply saddened by this travesty of</p> <p>science because Ricci implies here that</p> <p>the theory the hypothesis that the mind</p> <p>is simply the function of the brain has</p> <p>been tested time and time again and has</p> <p>always come out positive but that's not</p> <p>even remotely true I've looked for 25</p> <p>years at scientific study science</p> <p>scientific theory</p> <p>of the mind and reductionistic ones</p> <p>materialistic ones and interestingly</p> <p>they they differ a lot but they all have</p> <p>something in common not one of them is</p> <p>scientifically testable or has ever been</p> <p>tested scientifically they simply assume</p> <p>it's a matter of belief so this is</p> <p>really quite a travesty I would call it</p> <p>a scam a hoax</p> <p>I would call it brain washing because I</p> <p>think it's most literally correct is</p> <p>that that which is a very real problem</p> <p>and which Donald Donald Hoffman a very</p> <p>good neuroscientist at University of</p> <p>california-irvine he commented very</p> <p>cogently that ever since the late 19th</p> <p>century at a time of Thomas Huxley the</p> <p>founder of the Church of scientific</p> <p>materialism there's actually been no</p> <p>progress at all on solving the mind-body</p> <p>problem we know that the two are</p> <p>correlated but how are they correlated</p> <p>how does the placebo effect work how do</p> <p>chemicals electricity in the brain</p> <p>generate or even influence the mind how</p> <p>do our thoughts our emotions our desires</p> <p>and aspirations how do they influence</p> <p>the brain we are as ignorant now as we</p> <p>were 150 years ago and this is what</p> <p>happens when you pretend to have</p> <p>knowledge where all you have is belief</p> <p>is called an illusion of knowledge and</p> <p>historically has been the greatest</p> <p>impediment to scientific discovery</p> <p>imagine that you know something that</p> <p>would in fact you only believe and that</p> <p>is the standard view in modern</p> <p>psychology neuroscience and philosophy</p> <p>of mind 90% of them are all materialists</p> <p>and they simply assume that if you don't</p> <p>believe that you're either ignorant or</p> <p>stupid so this is a great challenge this</p> <p>is great empirical challenge it's not a</p> <p>battle of science and religion or</p> <p>Buddhism versus science it's actually</p> <p>rather on the contrary a challenge</p> <p>between empiricism and closed-minded</p> <p>dogmatism and Buddhist can be as</p> <p>dogmatic and closed-minded as anybody</p> <p>else but I'm sorry to say I found</p> <p>scientists can be as dogmatic and</p> <p>closed-minded as any religious</p> <p>fundamentalist I've ever met and so our</p> <p>salvation here if I may speak in an</p> <p>evangelical way is a return to</p> <p>experience a return to empiricism but</p> <p>not exclude first-person experience</p> <p>because about a hundred years ago with a</p> <p>rise behavioral psychology there was a</p> <p>decision</p> <p>again not a discovery but as this is</p> <p>decision we will no longer we behavioral</p> <p>psychologists will no longer refer to</p> <p>subjective experience of any kind will</p> <p>never speak of consciousness and we will</p> <p>not ever use introspection so imagine at</p> <p>the time of Galileo if the church had</p> <p>gotten really heavy-handed and said we</p> <p>can talk about the views of the sale of</p> <p>you know the stars and planets but never</p> <p>look through a telescope that's they did</p> <p>not succeed but the materialists have</p> <p>succeeded in banishing introspection</p> <p>from academic psychology let alone</p> <p>cognitive neuroscience for the last</p> <p>hundred years it's been quite a shame</p> <p>and so to the rescue as science I</p> <p>believe I'm speaking with some passion</p> <p>here but joyfulness as well Buddhism</p> <p>also falls into dogmatism in tradition</p> <p>into close-minded sectarianism it does</p> <p>people do that whether they're Marxists</p> <p>or the Republicans and so forth and so</p> <p>on</p> <p>we do that science can help rescue</p> <p>Buddhism from falling into close-minded</p> <p>traditionalism and ritualism and</p> <p>complacency it can help us return to</p> <p>empiricism we've got a great tradition</p> <p>of empiricism going back to the Buddha</p> <p>and the Buddhist can rescue the mind</p> <p>sciences further from the complacency of</p> <p>thinking they've already solved the my</p> <p>problem my body problem even to the</p> <p>point of absurdity like some</p> <p>neuroscientist saying consciousness</p> <p>doesn't exist there's no mind-body</p> <p>problem because there's no mind or one</p> <p>renowned philosophers mine saying</p> <p>appearances don't exist if you take that</p> <p>take those statements versus the</p> <p>statement that the universe is ten</p> <p>thousand years old and human beings</p> <p>existed out on the sixth day pretty much</p> <p>like us now which is more absurd</p> <p>forty-two percent of Americans believe</p> <p>that creationism eighteen percent</p> <p>believe that the Sun goes around the</p> <p>earth but what's more absurd those views</p> <p>are the views that introspection is</p> <p>impossible that subjective experiences</p> <p>don't exist because they're not physical</p> <p>consciousness that self doesn't exist</p> <p>and appearances don't exist I think the</p> <p>sight of materialism has pushed the</p> <p>furthest limits of absurdity so we come</p> <p>back to sanity that the mind does exist</p> <p>is enormous ly efficacious and in fact</p> <p>upon very careful and</p> <p>you may very well draw the conclusion</p> <p>that it is primary but now the</p> <p>ontological burden so to speak what is</p> <p>primary in the universe in the Buddhist</p> <p>view from the Pali Canon right through</p> <p>its open the mind is of paramount</p> <p>importance the course mind what we</p> <p>divide enta Phi is the psyche clearly</p> <p>that's dependent upon the body but</p> <p>that's not been doubted for millennia</p> <p>when the Buddha himself practice ascetic</p> <p>practices for six years he let his</p> <p>health really really get damaged he was</p> <p>weak emaciated and he saw that his mind</p> <p>had become weak and he recognized he had</p> <p>to restore his physical strength and</p> <p>health for his mind to bounce back and</p> <p>be strong and resilient so this it</p> <p>didn't no mystery since the time of the</p> <p>Buddha but that's the most superficial</p> <p>level of mind zouk chen the whole</p> <p>buddhist tradition is at large and the</p> <p>so Qin tradition in particular invites</p> <p>us go beneath the surface investigate</p> <p>the nature of mind the primacy of mind</p> <p>and some physicists are coming to the</p> <p>same conclusion after all what we do</p> <p>what do we know most immediately is</p> <p>information appearances in information</p> <p>and appearances are not physical and the</p> <p>very categories of mind of mind matter</p> <p>space time energy they're all conceptual</p> <p>constructs based on information</p> <p>informations not physical so which</p> <p>brings us back to zouk Chen there's the</p> <p>first point it's not Dogma it's not a</p> <p>catechism it's not you have to believe</p> <p>this but you must investigate until you</p> <p>come to some uncertainty is the mind</p> <p>primary or not and if it is alright</p> <p>that's something big but then a</p> <p>brilliant stroke and we see this running</p> <p>through all of duty on linguistic</p> <p>teachings oh my goodness that twenty</p> <p>minutes go by</p> <p>is that possible no that was supposed to</p> <p>be the prelude can I go a little bit</p> <p>longer okay at least have to give this</p> <p>that was really fast amazing but I</p> <p>warned I warned Daniel I do that but now</p> <p>that you see mine is primary then the</p> <p>next in the strategy this path in zou</p> <p>Chen is not universally true in all</p> <p>schools of Buddhism now investigate the</p> <p>nature of the mind that which apprehends</p> <p>that which knows that which observes</p> <p>observe the nature of the agent the mind</p> <p>that meditates that gets upset that</p> <p>becomes compassionate engages in virtue</p> <p>nonvirtue investigate this all creating</p> <p>sovereign the mind and what does he say</p> <p>here back to mutton feathers again in a</p> <p>visionary experience a being and</p> <p>appearing in one of his dreams since son</p> <p>of the claw of the clear light Vadra</p> <p>essence addressing digital mingi says</p> <p>your own mind is the basis of all</p> <p>samsara and Nirvana the origin from</p> <p>which it first emerges is empty the</p> <p>location in which it resides in the</p> <p>interim after it's arisen before passes</p> <p>is empty the destination to which it</p> <p>finally goes is empty perceive the</p> <p>essential nature of emptiness it this</p> <p>mind it has no form shape color or</p> <p>source it is neither one nor many and it</p> <p>is neither emanated nor reabsorbed it</p> <p>transcends the parameters of existence</p> <p>and non-existence it is empty of the</p> <p>conventional words of negation and</p> <p>affirmation it is spontaneously</p> <p>actualized as great emptiness since I</p> <p>said I would be punctual I'm gonna wrap</p> <p>up that rather long juicy quote is that</p> <p>no way I could finished in just a few</p> <p>minutes here's a strategy I was asked by</p> <p>one friend of mine to give a bit of</p> <p>pointing out instructions all right</p> <p>let's give it give it you take a crack</p> <p>at wean strategy here it's all very well</p> <p>to speak profound words and be citing</p> <p>great masters and so forth but when we</p> <p>return home if we're inspired by this</p> <p>path of the great protection how can we</p> <p>get up on our lovely little</p> <p>legs and start walking on the path I'll</p> <p>sit make a suggestion okay but I would</p> <p>suggest for those of us living in cities</p> <p>like Boston I live in the outskirts of</p> <p>Los Angeles I visit cities all over the</p> <p>world we all know it in this modern era</p> <p>with this way of life with this amount</p> <p>of information this amount of</p> <p>stimulation we have the amount of</p> <p>workload we have the demands on our</p> <p>attention that we have we are running an</p> <p>experiment on ourselves and I think is</p> <p>quite a cruel experiment to see how far</p> <p>we can be pushed without all of us going</p> <p>insane the first thing as we had in the</p> <p>preliminary exercise to learn in a</p> <p>non-trivial way how to set your body</p> <p>speech mind at ease no wonder MBSR</p> <p>mindfulness based stress reduction is so</p> <p>popular and so helpful because people</p> <p>are desperate to get some relief from</p> <p>strain and stress that's just wearing</p> <p>them out and sapping all the joy from</p> <p>their lives so to learn through</p> <p>discipline how to set the body and mind</p> <p>at ease mindfulness breathing is</p> <p>marvelous with it settle settle body</p> <p>speech and mind at ease and then</p> <p>mindfulness breathing full body</p> <p>awareness let your awareness permeate</p> <p>the whole field of the body but in the</p> <p>midst of that that's already take a</p> <p>little step towards zouk jam the great</p> <p>perfection and that is while attending</p> <p>to the sensations corresponding to or</p> <p>correlated with the respiration</p> <p>throughout the entire body kind of the</p> <p>flow of energy through the body</p> <p>corresponding to or related to the</p> <p>respiration while attending to the</p> <p>movements within the body corresponding</p> <p>to the respiration attend to this from a</p> <p>place of stillness your awareness your</p> <p>mental awareness resting in stillness</p> <p>while simultaneously attending to the</p> <p>flux the ebb and flow of the sensations</p> <p>of the breath throughout the body</p> <p>stillness and movement stillness and</p> <p>movement simultaneously as you calm as</p> <p>the mind stabilizes as the clarity of</p> <p>the mind like the Sun rising over the</p> <p>horizon the clarity that might becomes</p> <p>clearer and clearer but make a segue</p> <p>into a practice it's called by various</p> <p>names one is simply observing the mind</p> <p>again from a vantage point of stillness</p> <p>direct your attention now single point</p> <ul> <li>one out of six domains of experience</li> </ul> <p>the domain of mental events of thoughts</p> <p>of memories mental images the same</p> <p>domain in which dreams arise at night</p> <p>but also subjective impulses like</p> <p>desires and emotions and from the</p> <p>vantage of stillness of clarity of</p> <p>stillness awareness that is at ease</p> <p>still and clear observe the theater of</p> <p>the mind the comings and goings of</p> <p>thoughts emotions memories fantasies and</p> <p>so forth coming and going arising in the</p> <p>space of the mind resolving back into</p> <p>that space and observe it in an ongoing</p> <p>way from that vantage point of stillness</p> <p>without wit called psychologist called</p> <p>cognitive fusion without getting caught</p> <p>up and carried away by the memories the</p> <p>desires the emotions and so on and then</p> <p>as you go deeper look to the intervals</p> <p>between thoughts attend to the very</p> <p>space that the mind itself and it then</p> <p>clearly discerning ly observe what is</p> <p>the nature of this space is it physical</p> <p>space this is the face of the mind does</p> <p>it have color does it have shape does</p> <p>that have a center of periphery is that</p> <p>have form does it have any physical</p> <p>qualities whatsoever observe it closely</p> <p>the very space of the mind and then as</p> <p>we move in that in this strategy this is</p> <p>now a very condensed course as you're</p> <p>able to maintain that flow of clear</p> <p>discerning awareness of the space of the</p> <p>mind and observing also how thoughts</p> <p>emerge from that space not emerging from</p> <p>neurons which is a crazy idea</p> <p>the notion of dreams and motion coming</p> <p>from chemicals electricity one of the</p> <p>craziest ideas I've ever heard but it's</p> <p>groupthink one person says that a bunch</p> <p>of people say it ok dispense with that</p> <p>nonsense you can see thoughts arising</p> <p>from the space of the mind and</p> <p>dissolving back into the space of the</p> <p>mind and the thoughts are non-physical</p> <p>than the space that the mind is</p> <p>non-physical</p> <p>get over it you know and let this be</p> <p>incorporated into the scientific study</p> <p>of the mind we've been ignoring</p> <p>first-person perspective for a hundred</p> <p>and fifty years it's time to stop as</p> <p>they say in Italy basta enough already</p> <p>let's be scientific in the study of the</p> <p>mind by observing it carefully like all</p> <p>other branches of science observe</p> <p>carefully the phenomena they're trying</p> <p>to seek to understand don't you study</p> <p>brain and behavior</p> <p>so observe this based of the might and</p> <p>now do something very clever with draw</p> <p>the vector of your attention and</p> <p>withdraw right into the very nature of</p> <p>being aware itself have no</p> <p>directionality no vector no object of</p> <p>attention outside of awareness itself</p> <p>and simply rest in an ongoing flow of</p> <p>awareness of being aware consciousness</p> <p>of consciousness itself it makes common</p> <p>sense that if you want to understand</p> <p>something look at it closely for a</p> <p>sustained period</p> <p>that's how Galileo discovered the moons</p> <p>of Jupiter and sunspots and the phases</p> <p>of Venus and craters on the moon he</p> <p>observed carefully and in the sustained</p> <p>fashion and started the scientific</p> <p>revolution it's high time for the first</p> <p>revolution and the mine Sciences to</p> <p>begin but that means we have to do what</p> <p>Galileo did what Galileo did what Darwin</p> <p>did and what William James did look</p> <p>carefully at the phenomena you're</p> <p>seeking to understand observe</p> <p>consciousness naked ly without mediation</p> <p>we're almost there that's called</p> <p>schemata it's a sus lesson most profound</p> <p>method of schemata there isn't a whole</p> <p>Buddhist tradition the awareness of</p> <p>being conscious itself and now one step</p> <p>further and we'll slip into the domain</p> <p>absorption now carefully incisively</p> <p>observe that which is observing we call</p> <p>it the mind observe the mind we call it</p> <p>awareness</p> <p>observe awareness observe that which is</p> <p>aware that which thinks that which</p> <p>intends observe the observer and cut</p> <p>through the mind right down to the very</p> <p>ground which is Ripa and xoJane</p> <p>meditation is nothing more or less than</p> <p>cutting through to pristine awareness</p> <p>rickwaa and viewing reality from that</p> <p>perspective and that right there is the</p> <p>view of the great production so in your</p> <p>practice I just gave you enough to keep</p> <p>you busy for at least few days</p> <p>in your practice when you come to the</p> <p>end there when you're coming to the</p> <p>where you're able to sustain a flow of</p> <p>awareness of awareness and then you cut</p> <p>through the flow of awareness of</p> <p>awareness to the penetration to that</p> <p>which is aware you know the distinction</p> <p>between the awareness that gets</p> <p>distracted and gets dull and get</p> <p>centered and gets distracted again and</p> <p>that's the mind but as you cut through</p> <p>to that which is aware you may cut</p> <p>through to a dimension of awareness that</p> <p>is unborn and unceasing that never moves</p> <p>because it's not in time it's unchanging</p> <p>and you can never wrap your conceptual</p> <p>mind around it because this baseline</p> <p>this ground of awareness from which all</p> <p>conditioned states of consciousness</p> <p>emerge transcends a very parameters of</p> <p>existence and non-existence it</p> <p>transcends all conceptual categories it</p> <p>can be known is not an ultimate mystery</p> <p>it can be known directly without</p> <p>mediation but only by itself it can know</p> <p>itself but your conceptual mind cannot</p> <p>grasp it it's beyond its paygrade it's</p> <p>beyond its scope so this rig by this</p> <p>pristine awareness it is present right</p> <p>now it is where your awareness it is it</p> <p>is where your thoughts are it is not</p> <p>something separate it's not somebody</p> <p>else's it's not gods or Buddha's or some</p> <p>other persons it's the ground state of</p> <p>your own awareness and not and then this</p> <p>node hidden in plain sight so try that</p> <p>see what happened thank you so much</p> <p>so the best question is what is the</p> <p>difference between the shaman to</p> <p>practice of awareness of awareness and</p> <p>the practice of trencher very good I</p> <p>could draw for my own background here</p> <p>but I'd rather draw from the explicit</p> <p>answer to that question from from and so</p> <p>this question was posed to him last fall</p> <p>and his answer in fact I think I was one</p> <p>maybe I was one that I think I might</p> <p>have been I wanted to get just</p> <p>razor-sharp clarity and I did and so</p> <p>here's the answer and that is anyone can</p> <p>practice awareness of awareness you can</p> <p>be a materialist a Christian an agnostic</p> <p>Muslim Buddhist anything you like it has</p> <p>no theory had no viewer that goes with</p> <p>it</p> <p>it's technology some of this technology</p> <p>is contempt into technology the passion</p> <p>is contemplative science and to become</p> <p>the vidyadhara or practice that</p> <p>meditation is very deep science and so</p> <p>to practice awareness of awareness is</p> <p>simply resting in the flow this</p> <p>phenomenological or expansion flow of</p> <p>being aware that's all there is to it</p> <p>but now you may use the same method and</p> <p>that is just be resting in the flow of</p> <p>awareness</p> <p>perhaps observing that which is aware</p> <p>but if you cut through the conditioned</p> <p>mind this mind that is arising from</p> <p>moment a moment that is conditioned by</p> <p>many many causes and additions that</p> <p>becomes virtuous and non-virtuous dull</p> <p>and clear and so forth if you cut</p> <p>through this fluctuating and conditioned</p> <p>mind you cut through that it's texture</p> <p>it means cutting through something rigid</p> <p>and gnarly and cut through to the ground</p> <p>then and you're actually are viewing</p> <p>reality from the perspective of Ripa</p> <p>that's your vantage point the method is</p> <p>the same but because you're viewing</p> <p>reality from the perspective of rikta</p> <p>the method is now textured so the same</p> <p>method without the view is schemata with</p> <p>the view is textured</p> <p>so far over ordinary experience we know</p> <p>that physical brief affects our mind</p> <p>let's say the body's tired and drink</p> <p>your coffee we know it affects the</p> <p>clarity and so on so we see that cause</p> <p>and effect of correlation so are you</p> <p>saying that Britten effects let's say</p> <p>mind or ordinary parts a battle alone</p> <p>Kristina marinus that is independent of</p> <p>the brain there's a very clear</p> <p>demarcation within the suction tradition</p> <p>but I've seen it elsewhere as well of</p> <p>three dimensions of mind and what</p> <p>psychologists study is what the</p> <p>Buddhists call and the skull including</p> <p>Freud and Freud for sure and modern</p> <p>cogman psychology affective psychology</p> <p>and cognitive science when they refer to</p> <p>mind it's what Buddhists call course</p> <p>mind course mind and this is the mind</p> <p>and not only mental awareness but also</p> <p>visual perception auditory and so forth</p> <p>so course mind includes the five</p> <p>physical senses and mental the mind as</p> <p>in this this phenomenon this faculty</p> <p>that by which we remember think imagine</p> <p>hope fear and so forth and this arises</p> <p>in dependence upon the brain right and</p> <p>this been known but it's this is not</p> <p>breaking news this has been known for a</p> <p>very long time damage the brain and you</p> <p>afferent Fred mine had his optic nerve</p> <p>damage</p> <p>now he's blind in one eye okay visual</p> <p>cortex is fine but one little part the</p> <p>optic nerve is damaged now he's blind in</p> <p>one eye and likewise with Alzheimer's</p> <p>with Lou Gehrig's disease with brain</p> <p>trauma with schizophrenia with genetic</p> <p>with with mental imbalances that may</p> <p>have a genetic influence all of these</p> <p>are influencing the brain but also</p> <p>through mental training de viously</p> <p>exercising the mind so neurogenesis</p> <p>kicks in we know this a very strong</p> <p>correlations and here neuroscience is</p> <p>providing a very great service in in</p> <p>highlighting many of these strong</p> <p>correlations we also know as a thought</p> <p>experiment</p> <p>I'll do it on myself so I won't seem</p> <p>mean to others if I take a mallet with a</p> <p>hammer and I just start hitting my head</p> <p>with it very hard</p> <p>I'll start losing one faculty after</p> <p>another after another until I'm dead and</p> <p>that would look like but you damage the</p> <p>mine a little bit and then more and more</p> <p>and now you really sledgehammer it and</p> <p>I'm no longer breathing and now the</p> <p>brain is now finished if you're studying</p> <p>the brain of studying the mind only from</p> <p>physical perspective the very reasonable</p> <p>conclusion would be look damaged be in a</p> <p>little bit and you go blind or you can't</p> <p>remember remember as well or if you have</p> <p>emotional bipolarity or what have you</p> <p>damaged it more you're more mentally</p> <p>impaired and damaged that a whole lot</p> <p>you don't have a mind anymore</p> <p>this is a very natural reasonable</p> <p>conclusion if you're looking at the mind</p> <p>from only the outside but in a way it's</p> <p>not breaking news we've known this for a</p> <p>very long time and so in that dimension</p> <p>of the mind why the Buddha needed to get</p> <p>some a good meal and restore his health</p> <p>to be true enlightenment this was a</p> <p>message from the very beginning as a</p> <p>Buddhism but with there's something in</p> <p>between this mind which psychologists</p> <p>have studied indirectly by way of brain</p> <p>behavior and questionnaires and the</p> <p>Buddhist content ative Hindu Christian</p> <p>Sufi and so forth have examined very</p> <p>rigorously from a first-person</p> <p>perspective there's something between</p> <p>this mind was definitely my mind I'm 67</p> <p>my mind did not exist 68 years ago Alan</p> <p>Wallace at mind nowhere in the universe</p> <p>and 68 years from now I think is a very</p> <p>safe bet Alan's mind will not exist</p> <p>anywhere in the universe because this</p> <p>person's mind is arising upon</p> <p>independence upon this person brain</p> <p>damage it and there are consequences but</p> <p>is that all there is to it</p> <p>I call if one concludes well what we</p> <p>study it is all there is I call that a</p> <p>flat mind a perspective like Flat Earth</p> <p>there's a flat mind because by and large</p> <p>academic psychology neuroscientists are</p> <p>studying only normal people and mentally</p> <p>impaired in brain damage brain damaged</p> <p>people and when they do study meditators</p> <p>they studied their brains and behavior</p> <p>you know this like trying to understand</p> <p>meditation by step understanding</p> <p>mathematics by studying studying math</p> <p>math mathematician brains it's not</p> <p>really a very skillful approach and so</p> <p>when you shut down the mind that is you</p> <p>deactivate the mind what we call it</p> <p>falling asleep and the course mind is</p> <p>inactive in non lucid stage for non REM</p> <p>sleep deep asleep you don't explicitly</p> <p>know anything at all</p> <p>you're not even that you're asleep so</p> <p>many many psychologists think then</p> <p>you're totally unconscious I beg to</p> <p>differ</p> <p>you have no explicit consciousness but</p> <p>there's an implicit flow of</p> <p>consciousness and we call that the</p> <p>substrate consciousness or the alive it</p> <p>Nana from the so Chen perspective but of</p> <p>course we don't get normally get to</p> <p>enjoy it because we're not explicitly</p> <p>aware of it</p> <p>but it is possible to be lucid in</p> <p>dreamless sleep you can be in deep</p> <p>dreamless sleep and know it that is</p> <p>definitely possible</p> <p>just like lucid dreaming is possible</p> <p>this is possible we enter into this</p> <p>state and substrate consciousness when</p> <p>we fall deep asleep this is AB evanka</p> <p>and the tera vaada tradition when you go</p> <p>comatose you faint you achieve schemata</p> <p>and you die but among those various</p> <p>options about four of them would just</p> <p>happen naturally schemata you access</p> <p>that same dimension of consciousness but</p> <p>you do so with increasing clarity as</p> <p>you're proceeding along the path to</p> <p>access to the first jhana so when you</p> <p>arrive there it is radiantly clear like</p> <p>moving from a 10 watt bulb to a thousand</p> <p>watt bulb and that dimension of</p> <p>consciousness in the Buddhist view and</p> <p>this is I apophysis but not a Dogma or</p> <p>it can be then it's boring but as an</p> <p>empirical hypothesis this is ruling this</p> <p>dimension of consciousness is one that</p> <p>carries on from lifetime to lifetime and</p> <p>it not the brain is the repository of</p> <p>memories the virtual tendencies and so</p> <p>forth and that's a testable hypothesis</p> <p>and how is it tested tradin a number of</p> <p>people to achieve summative to rest in</p> <p>that substrate consciousness which is</p> <p>not contingent upon the brain perceive</p> <p>the brain carries on after brain death</p> <p>it in the Buddhist view is the</p> <p>repository of memories predilections</p> <p>habits abilities and so forth and so on</p> <p>so here's a very simple test unlike all</p> <p>of the scientific theories that are</p> <p>rooted in materialism none of which can</p> <p>be tested or have been tested utterly</p> <p>contrary to what Ricci implied at least</p> <p>other people say this is a testable</p> <p>hypothesis a scientific hypothesis train</p> <p>a number people the more the better</p> <p>to achieve schemata and then following</p> <p>the teachings of Buddha ghosts of 1500</p> <p>years ago a great tera vaada commentator</p> <p>takes that people at least with sha Mata</p> <p>even better if they've achieved higher</p> <p>states of Samadhi and then have them</p> <p>direct their attention to the path</p> <p>and see if they can retrieve vertically</p> <p>memories from their youth their</p> <p>childhood which is said to be true you</p> <p>can do that and then ask a 66 year old</p> <p>not this one but somebody else there's a</p> <p>chief schemata say now what you recall</p> <p>now that you're you're you're accessing</p> <p>true memories from the time you're four</p> <p>and three and two years old now okay mr.</p> <p>Wallace was the chief janitor</p> <p>hypothetically purely huh</p> <p>now what when you direct the laser of</p> <p>your attention because you've got an</p> <p>attention it's like a laser now direct</p> <p>it to where whirring what were you</p> <p>experiencing sixty-eight years ago</p> <p>perfectly good question and there are</p> <p>three possibility logical possibilities</p> <p>the shona tete-a-tete one who actually</p> <p>achieved it says I'm sorry I'm coming</p> <p>with a blank screen no data the</p> <p>materialist would say I told you so</p> <p>another one to come up with come up with</p> <p>I remember this I remember this and is</p> <p>all fantasy just fantasy you know I was</p> <p>Cleopatra I was Napoleon yeah maybe but</p> <p>there's a third possibility the person</p> <p>comes up the memories and they're tested</p> <p>scientifically by open-minded critical</p> <p>skeptical scientists or anybody else and</p> <p>say okay who were what is your memory oh</p> <p>you were this old man living in Buenos</p> <p>Aires</p> <p>tell us more and then they do</p> <p>investigation they into an investigation</p> <p>investigation and there is a way to</p> <p>empirically put to the test which has</p> <p>been done thousands of times already</p> <p>within the Buddhist and Hindu tradition</p> <p>and Taoist traditions do it in the</p> <p>monitor scientific context there's a</p> <p>dimension of consciousness that is not</p> <p>brain dependent and it's out of that</p> <p>continuum of consciousness that might</p> <p>emerges so we asked for what are the</p> <p>origins of mind is not neurons it's not</p> <p>synapses dendrite 2d glial cells as some</p> <p>as hugly said this is like pulling a</p> <p>genie out of a lamp</p> <p>it's magical thinking or Giulio Tononi a</p> <p>neuroscientist at university of</p> <p>wisconsin said this is like a macula</p> <p>conception the thing that chemicals</p> <p>electricity actually give rise to</p> <p>subjective experience I've studied</p> <p>physics it's it's a wacko physics they</p> <p>know a lot of physicists know a lot</p> <p>about matter and energy there's no</p> <p>suggestion anywhere that they give rise</p> <p>to dreams</p> <p>it's a silly idea that's become</p> <p>commonplace Britta is another order of</p> <p>magnitude beyond that Ripa is</p> <p>transcended substrate consciousness is</p> <p>present era it's within the realm of</p> <p>deep psychology they say transpersonal</p> <p>psychology but empirical but for that</p> <p>you need to develop the appropriate</p> <p>technology and that shaman to realize</p> <p>the empty nature of mind you need the</p> <p>passion to cut through the conditioned</p> <p>mind to unconditioned mind</p> <p>for that you need option the question is</p> <p>how no what is a relationship between</p> <p>devotion and specifically group Korea</p> <p>devotion or Guru yoga and the practice</p> <p>of zouk Chen what's a relationship how</p> <p>important is it and insofar as it is</p> <p>important how do you go about doing it</p> <p>right generally speaking in all schools</p> <p>of Buddhism starting with a foundation</p> <p>Pali Canon the relationship with economy</p> <p>through the spiritual friend the</p> <p>spiritual mentor is enormous ly</p> <p>important it's a guide imagine trying to</p> <p>learn guitar on your own with no guitar</p> <p>teacher learning mathematics just by</p> <p>picking up mathematics books you know</p> <p>can it be done yellen principle there</p> <p>are prodigies who just are self-taught</p> <p>but we know how rare they are so that's</p> <p>for chemistry for learning medicine</p> <p>would you like to have have brain</p> <p>surgery done on yourself by person who</p> <p>read a lot of books on it and I think I</p> <p>think I I think I can do it can I try in</p> <p>your brain you know for any serious</p> <p>sophisticated level of knowledge you</p> <p>want a teacher and serious and</p> <p>sophisticated is a pretty good</p> <p>characterization of the were Noble</p> <p>Truths if your aspiration is to be</p> <p>forever and completely free of all</p> <p>mental afflictions</p> <p>that's nothing trivial about that and so</p> <p>clearly you're gonna be a lot more</p> <p>effective if you find an authentic</p> <p>teacher and relate to this person a very</p> <p>meaningful respectful reverent way but</p> <p>that's true actually for everything else</p> <p>too as we move into end in the in the</p> <p>Tibetan tradition they say if you're</p> <p>following let's say the shravaka path it</p> <p>has to become in our heart view your own</p> <p>teacher as as if he or she were an</p> <p>emissary or an ambassador of the Buddha</p> <p>because this is as close to the Buddha</p> <p>as you're gonna get</p> <p>the Buddha's 2,500 years ago but this is</p> <p>an unbroken continuum a lineage a</p> <p>current</p> <p>of the teachings and the teacher you</p> <p>have make sure you choose well the</p> <p>teacher was authentic is ethical is well</p> <p>motivated has profound understanding</p> <p>it's a skillful teacher and is teaching</p> <p>for one reason only above all one reason</p> <p>that's compassion if there's any other</p> <p>motivation for teaching find another</p> <p>teacher because it's probably not going</p> <p>to be motivation mistaken be to your</p> <p>advantage so first of all choose well in</p> <p>the Mahayana tradition it goes even</p> <p>deeper now view your teacher as if he or</p> <p>she were a Buddha as a conduit of the</p> <p>blessings of dharmakaya or the blessings</p> <p>of the Buddha as not simply a historical</p> <p>character but a living presence and so</p> <p>they're a very deeply spiritual view of</p> <p>the Buddha mind on acai being everywhere</p> <p>present but like light coming through a</p> <p>magnifying glass</p> <p>really funneled through focusing through</p> <p>an authentic my own a Buddhist teacher</p> <p>there's a person with experience of bodhichitta insight of emptiness some</p> <p>experience of schemata skillful teacher</p> <p>knowledgeable experienced and</p> <p>compassionate when we move into Vaudrey</p> <p>jana and then specifically zouk chen now</p> <p>we're doing something quite</p> <p>extraordinary which makes sense if and</p> <p>only if one has some genuine insight</p> <p>into emptiness and genuine intuitive</p> <p>affirmation is very least of the</p> <p>omnipresent nature of dharmakaya the</p> <p>theme that comes in the Utada tantra one</p> <p>of the five works of Maitreya that the</p> <p>mine streams of every sense of being are</p> <p>saturated by Buddha nature saturated by</p> <p>the mind of the buddha indivisibly</p> <p>saturated by so we're your guru is where</p> <p>your gurus mind is there is the</p> <p>Dharmakaya there is rick but there is</p> <p>primordial consciousness so then it's a</p> <p>matter of choice if you're finally in</p> <p>job chen it's a matter of choice it's</p> <p>perfectly didn't for example i some</p> <p>people regard me as their lamas and I</p> <p>teach Doc Chen so for some people I'm as</p> <p>OPM Lama does that mean that suddenly</p> <p>I'm a highly realized perfected being</p> <p>not even remotely but where I am as</p> <p>where Daniel is and where is Kestrel is</p> <p>and anybody else here where you are</p> <p>there is Buddha mind so I'm gonna say</p> <p>that where my mind is there is</p> <p>mind it's true where I am there's also a</p> <p>sentry beings mind like guy from</p> <p>California no that's also true where I</p> <p>am here's my substrate consciousness</p> <p>carried on from past lies we'll carry on</p> <p>in the future that's also here so it's</p> <p>your choice</p> <p>and it's not an invitation to be a guru</p> <p>it's just a choice in general that is</p> <p>you attend to your guru you can if you</p> <p>wish simply regard your rule is</p> <p>essentially you could very well be true</p> <p>you can view that you grow as this</p> <p>continuum based upon the continuum of</p> <p>substrate consciousness but you can if</p> <p>you wish seeing the empty nature of your</p> <p>guru as a sentient being that there is</p> <p>nothing from the grooved side that is</p> <p>inherently a sentient being try to find</p> <p>it try to find in yourself if you ever</p> <p>look within and tried to find that</p> <p>nuclear sentient being that is you and I</p> <p>think I can guarantee you're not gonna</p> <p>find it it is conventionally existent</p> <p>and that's all and so it's a matter of</p> <p>choice where we never thought he we even</p> <p>had a choice but we may if we choose</p> <p>look through the veneer of appearances</p> <p>which are strongly conditioned by our</p> <p>own Karma our predilections our beliefs</p> <p>preconceptions and so forth look through</p> <p>the veneer of the course mind look</p> <p>through the veneer of the substrate</p> <p>consciousness as with x-ray vision look</p> <p>right down to the core the Buddha nature</p> <p>that is there where your guru is</p> <p>dharmakaya that is where there where</p> <p>your guru is and on that basis designate</p> <p>this is my guru my guru is a vodka da da</p> <p>da da da da da da da</p> <p>Samantha bottom Adi Buddha my guru is</p> <p>Buddha because where my guru is there is</p> <p>blood of mind and it's on that basis I'm</p> <p>identifying my guru and for me my guru</p> <p>is Buddha but this goes hand in hand we</p> <p>say well what's the big deal why are you</p> <p>doing it</p> <p>well number one you get a lot more</p> <p>benefit that way but two this is all</p> <p>preamble as a preparation because the</p> <p>whole point of Adrienne in general ends</p> <p>option in particular is to realize when</p> <p>you cut through the veneer of your own</p> <p>self preconceptions your ordinary sense</p> <p>of who you are your ordinary sense of</p> <p>identity ordinary way of appearing to</p> <p>yourself cut through that there's</p> <p>nothing there that exists from its own</p> <p>side cut through that cut through the</p> <p>substrate consciousness and know your</p> <p>own face as rickwaa which has always</p> <p>been present so the devotion the</p> <p>reverence the focus on the Guru as</p> <p>Buddha is really simply the other side</p> <p>of the coin of coming to know yourself</p> <p>as a Buddha now in a way it's very</p> <p>helpful to have an extraordinary teacher</p> <p>I know Daniels teacher going on image a</p> <p>extraordinary master and you see such</p> <p>people as long as the Dalai Lama diggle</p> <p>consider but you do join room which is</p> <p>ona [ __ ] a I've met such people in you</p> <p>standing all of them if you kind of get</p> <p>them say whoa and what comes with that</p> <p>is oh boy he's so much not like me you</p> <p>know when I first met the Dalai Lama</p> <p>it's like whoa he's my guru but boy is</p> <p>he not like me and jung junha virtue</p> <p>vidyadhara oh boy is he not like me you</p> <p>know and got a temper Qi and other great</p> <p>teachers the sixteenth karmapa the</p> <p>current come out awesome beings the</p> <p>current incarnation renews Malinga young</p> <p>man awesome and so it's very easy to</p> <p>feel devotion for these beings who just</p> <p>manifest to us with majesty with with a</p> <p>deep sense of the sacred but in so doing</p> <p>we also have a sense of and then there's</p> <p>me way down here and it actually can</p> <p>support or reinforce the sense</p> <p>aw shucks little old mean but that's not</p> <p>the point but not the point is not too</p> <p>agile eight or to revere the grew as an</p> <p>end in itself all of that is a</p> <p>preparation for realizing your own mind</p> <p>as Buddha mind and so in a way it's</p> <p>actually more potent to have a grew your</p> <p>root guru is opium master who appears to</p> <p>you a lot like yourself maybe even the</p> <p>same skin color to be helpful to have</p> <p>same gender same country same language</p> <p>boy you're pretty much like me a little</p> <p>bit better but pretty much like me</p> <p>if you can view that person there seems</p> <p>so similar to yourself if you can cut</p> <p>through the veneer of that person and</p> <p>seen that person as a Buddha oh then</p> <p>you're right next door to recognize your</p> <p>own nature's Buddha so that's the</p> <p>advantage of having an ordinary schmuck</p> <p>who's qualified suk-jin teacher I've</p> <p>been authorized to teach so check i'm</p> <p>ordinary schmuck that's who I am</p> <p>but I've been qualified to teach auction</p> <p>and I do it with my utmost ability to</p> <p>not distort the teachings so in that</p> <p>regard most I think most ocean teachings</p> <p>are much more teachers are much more</p> <p>realization Linehan but I the advantage</p> <p>of being ordinary monk so what is the</p> <p>sharma to meditation that you are</p> <p>teaching in this course I suppose are</p> <p>you supposed to take awareness as an</p> <p>object or are you supposed to sink back</p> <p>into subjectivity or something else it's</p> <p>not so much matter of thinking back that</p> <p>sounds very closeted ativ or ruminating</p> <p>it's not that Sochi Ahmed is not really</p> <p>thinking back into but it's SEM Nilda</p> <p>baba and that is settling the mind in</p> <p>its unconditioned state not not</p> <p>ultimately unconditioned but</p> <p>unconditioned on a relative sense</p> <p>resting releasing releasing all grasping</p> <p>while maintaining the flow of discerning</p> <p>non conceptual awareness so when we</p> <p>first start the Shama to practice of</p> <p>simply observing the mind we're</p> <p>observing thoughts images memories</p> <p>coming up dujun Linga comments in the</p> <p>passage I would have read to you but it</p> <p>would have taken a lot longer than I</p> <p>anticipated you're observing in the mind</p> <p>with the mind the conceptual mind is</p> <p>observing the conceptual mind so you're</p> <p>basically in it it's like observing a</p> <p>swamp with you know with you up to your</p> <p>neck in the swamp but then as you go</p> <p>deeper into it the cognitive fusion with</p> <p>the activities of the mind diminishes</p> <p>diminishes diminishes and so </p> <p>dudjom lingpa says it's much more like a shepherd watching his flock out in an open plain while the shepherd sit still while the flock moves hither and yon and so that cognitive fusion is dissipating and the sense of the stillness for awareness as you're observing thoughts you invert your awareness in upon itself but it's still likely your awareness is still very likely to be conditioned by your thoughts your ideas your preconceptions your beliefs about consciousness because after all our experience is generally strongly conditioned by our past experience language acculturation personal history and so on but as you continue to release and relax while maintaining the clarity then you're you're not thinking back into but the locus of your awareness the word is Papa descends from it's an ordinary field which is all cut up in dualistic thinking and so forth radical deepened demarcation between subject and object it's slipping deeper and deeper into this dimension of consciousness</p> <p>that is all that's left when you fall</p> <p>down when you fall deep asleep</p> <p>all that's left when you've gone brain</p> <p>dead underway to dying you're almost</p> <p>dead in fact this is the point at which</p> <p>you know the Buddhist doctor said now</p> <p>you're dead when your mind is</p> <p>irretrievably we dissolve back into the</p> <p>substrate consciousness so you're not</p> <p>observing substrate consciousness from</p> <p>the mind substrate consciousness</p> <p>experiencing itself that's non</p> <p>conceptual not absolutely but that</p> <p>resting in the substrate consciousness</p> <p>is unconditioned by gender ethnicity</p> <p>language personal history and</p> <p>unconditioned by the brain that's the</p> <p>high pot and it's a testable hypothesis</p> <p>that's what makes me so joyful about it</p> <p>this one we can actually get some</p> <p>knowledge and not just be bickering back</p> <p>and forth religion versus science</p> <p>religious dogma versus scientific dogma</p> <p>let's break out of that that's what the</p> <p>Dalai Lama was getting at you know and</p> <p>so it's still schemata when you're</p> <p>resting in the substrate consciousness</p> <p>and the type of mindfulness there when</p> <p>you've achieved schemata Boojum limba</p> <p>says this is self-illuminating</p> <p>mindfulness where the substrate</p> <p>consciousness is illuminating itself or</p> <p>in the territory tradition is called ba</p> <p>ba so cipta the brightly shining mind</p> <p>that vivanco which is the ground of</p> <p>becoming from which all the giovanna or</p> <p>activities of the mind including the</p> <p>five physical senses all emerge and into</p> <p>which they dissolve in deep sleep right</p> <p>and so that's still shammed but it's</p> <p>gone very quiet and only subliminally</p> <p>conceptual at a very very subtle level</p> <p>and there's a subtle level of grasping</p> <p>when you achieve Shama it's said to be</p> <p>characterized by three</p> <p>and this doesn't matter whether you're</p> <p>Christian agnostic Buddhist into what</p> <p>have you this is like it said that every</p> <p>smoke every snow crystals every</p> <p>snowflake is completely unique so it</p> <p>said yeah but if you melt any of them</p> <p>then one drop of water is like any other</p> <p>drop of water and so your your mind is</p> <p>absolutely unique there's nobody that</p> <p>has your mind in the entire universe I</p> <p>mean it's an opera very certainty right</p> <p>nobody has your personal history case</p> <p>closed</p> <p>but if you melt and that's determined</p> <p>term that's often used metaphorically if</p> <p>you melt your mind down to your</p> <p>substrate conscious from which your mind</p> <p>arose and which your mind will dissolve</p> <p>when you die then that's like a drop of</p> <p>water that is your direct experience of</p> <p>it now it is conditioned by karma past</p> <p>memories and so forth and so on but when</p> <p>you're just resting in hitch in the</p> <p>Bhuvana or the substrate consciousness</p> <p>upon achieving schemata they're just</p> <p>wreak wallah teas they sell me dopa its</p> <p>blissful luminous and non conceptual</p> <p>that doesn't matter who you are what</p> <p>your belief system is whether you're</p> <p>human or non-human these are the</p> <p>qualities when you clearly illuminate</p> <p>this underlying continuum of</p> <p>consciousness from within itself and</p> <p>it's beyond brain beyond conditioning of</p> <p>this life versus that but it's the</p> <p>ground of becoming so when you take your</p> <p>next birth your next maybe will be a</p> <p>woman or a man who knows what next time</p> <p>your mind then will emerge from that</p> <p>continuum beyond that though that's</p> <p>where the pristine awareness is you cut</p> <p>through that then you're into what's</p> <p>called the fourth time because Rick but</p> <p>is not located in the past or the future</p> <p>and not even located within this this</p> <p>narrow sliver of the present moment it's</p> <p>in the fourth time beyond time it's</p> <p>beyond it's a temporal and non-local but</p> <p>I've wanted to clarify with you how does</p> <p>intention fit into that intention</p> <p>because I associate intention with</p> <p>action from being</p> <p>just see well very important term</p> <p>there's a very closer related term which</p> <p>is highlighted enormous degree in my</p> <p>under tradition Tibetan Vajrayana and so</p> <p>chen is motivation motivation motivation</p> <p>intention very close right and so it's</p> <p>very true in our extra spectrum</p> <p>outward-looking modern society you've</p> <p>ever heard the phrase don't just sit</p> <p>there do something stupid never heard</p> <p>that one before</p> <p>so we are your eccentric civilization</p> <p>for at least the past 400 years there's</p> <p>been a civilization with the Protestant</p> <p>ethic with our conquering of North South</p> <p>America most of the rest of the globe</p> <p>you know through imperialism colonialism</p> <p>and so forth with the rise of the sign</p> <p>of revolution and the project</p> <p>Reformation I mean all these forces</p> <p>converging in on one thing be productive</p> <p>conquer at least but do something you</p> <p>know and therefore invention is always</p> <p>linked to doing something but of course</p> <p>if you become inspired by the teachings</p> <p>and practices absorption will you do it</p> <p>or not it's your it's your choice which</p> <p>means it's your intention but then when</p> <p>it comes to Vaudrey on in particular and</p> <p>so chen more specifically it is said</p> <p>actually there's only one authentic or</p> <p>suitable fit in terms of motivation it's</p> <p>got to be bodhichitta if one practices</p> <p>VAD Rihanna or zou Chen with it with a</p> <p>self centered motivation but I want</p> <p>something for me I'm out for myself I</p> <p>just want to achieve something myself</p>

spontaneously emerges</p> <p>from Ripa and that's intention so</p> <p>intention motivation as just part of</p> <p>mental health you know we can speak very</p> <p>deeply about soake shin but I think it's</p> <p>good to come back to where we just live</p> <p>our day-to-day lives whether in Boston</p> <p>or anywhere else how relevant is the are</p> <p>these teachings which</p> <p>quite esoteric in any way relevant are</p> <p>they for us in our day-to-day lives</p> <p>doing grocery shopping balancing our</p> <p>checkbooks hopefully and just doing the</p> <p>stuff that we need to do throughout the</p> <p>course of the day and I would suggest</p> <p>that we living in modernity</p> <p>it's especially the 20th century but it</p> <p>goes back to the 17th century Blaise</p> <p>Pascal the great map the French</p> <p>mathematician and philosopher he said</p> <p>and I paraphrase very concisely he said</p> <p>the trouble the problem with modern man</p> <p>is our ability inability to say quietly</p> <p>in our chambers even then we were</p> <p>addicted to and I think it is a literal</p> <p>addiction addicted to stimulation</p> <p>addicted to doing addicted keeping busy</p> <p>even if it's keeping busy with something</p> <p>that is absolutely devoid of any meaning</p> <p>whatsoever better that then just be</p> <p>quiet and be still but you know this is</p> <p>wisdom of the ages and it's east and</p> <p>west be still and know thyself</p> <p>be still and know thyself deeper and</p> <p>deeper and deeper but you won't do that</p> <p>unless you have intention Ellen on this</p> <p>note Galecki I'm going to take a little</p> <p>trip off the left-field Greek antiquity</p> <p>Socrates Plato Aristotle these powerful</p> <p>thinkers they're still influencing us to</p> <p>this day that's pretty formidable they</p> <p>do a very short and clear distinction</p> <p>between cadonia and this is over the</p> <p>pleasure we get from the world from</p> <p>family friends sensual enjoyments</p> <p>activity successes prestige wealth power</p> <p>and so forth cadonia</p> <p>good bad neutral is everything but it's</p> <p>Adonia and it comes and goes and you die</p> <p>it just goes right everything you've</p> <p>acquired is lost and then there is what</p> <p>the Greek call eudaimonia genuine</p> <p>well-being and if you don't is the joy</p> <p>we get from the world eudaimonia is the</p> <p>well-being that we bring to the world</p> <p>it's by our way of life by the quality</p> <p>of mind we bring to the world by the</p> <p>quality of insight of wisdom we bring to</p> <p>the world and that can carry us through</p> <p>all the vicissitudes of life and death</p> <p>right but in order to prioritize to</p> <p>place of great value not on the pursuit</p> <p>of eudaimonia but the cultivation of</p> <p>eudaimonia for that we must spend time</p> <p>in stillness as I was forced to when I</p> <p>was 24 years old I was told I had to sit</p> <p>through ten days of goenka's retreat</p> <p>when he gave very little teaching and</p> <p>had a sit for 11 hours a day and it was</p> <p>just miserable seeing what a mess my</p> <p>mind was and I thought if this is what</p> <p>I'm bringing to the world</p> <p>maybe I should clean up my own act</p> <p>before I have any pretence of being a</p> <p>Buddhist scholar or anything else you</p> <p>know and so that time of stillness it's</p> <p>a time for searing honesty and as we</p> <p>have this term genuine happiness from</p> <p>the Greeks I coined a term genuine</p> <p>unhappiness and as he donate is always</p> <p>stimulus driven it's a response to</p> <p>something pleasant</p> <p>there's stimulus driven unhappiness</p> <p>that's also a response to something</p> <p>unpleasant something happens that I</p> <p>didn't want or something doesn't happen</p> <p>that they did want and then I'm a happy</p> <p>that's pretty simple but what about when</p> <p>you're sitting quietly in your chambers</p> <p>as Blaise Pascal suggested and there's</p> <p>nothing good or bad happening to you</p> <p>you're living just sitting in a room</p> <p>quietly and what if while you're sitting</p> <p>there quietly in good health welfare not</p> <p>thirsty not cold not too hard just</p> <p>sitting there if in that simplicity in</p> <p>that solitude of just being yourself in</p> <p>the universe if you experienced dukkha a</p> <p>sense of uneasiness of dissatisfaction a</p> <p>boredom of restlessness of agitation of</p> <p>malaise</p> <p>that's genuine unhappiness because</p> <p>that's what you're bringing to the world</p> <p>not what you're getting from it and so</p> <p>if our ground state is one where you're</p> <p>sitting quietly with nothing coming in</p> <p>Pleasant or unpleasant from the</p> <p>environment and not even thinking happy</p> <p>thoughts or having unhappy thoughts just</p> <p>being present and if you so cultivate</p> <p>the balance of</p> <p>mind then a sense of well-being Springs</p> <p>right from the very nature of your mind</p> <p>itself it's a symptom of a wonderfully</p> <p>balanced mind a symptom of a healthy</p> <p>mind whereas a mind that is chronically</p> <p>and eventually prone to rumination</p> <p>craving hostility agitation restlessness</p> <p>egotism boredom and so forth these are</p> <p>all symptoms the dukkha of that is a</p> <p>symptom of a mind it's fundamentally</p> <p>unhealthy and how we deal with that in</p> <p>modernity I am very sad to say is lose</p> <p>ourselves in work lose ourselves after</p> <p>work in entertainment and then lose</p> <p>ourselves in drugs alcohol nicotine</p> <p>legal drugs illegal drugs and if</p> <p>anything seriously wrong with your mind</p> <p>well after all it's probably a brain</p> <p>disorder to take a drug just say yes</p> <p>and that's what we're telling our</p> <p>teenagers if they have depression which</p> <p>is on the rise gonna ten times since the</p> <p>rise of modern neuroscience which is</p> <p>supposed to solve our problem mentally</p> <p>because they're actually brain disorders</p> <p>the president's gone up ten times over</p> <p>the last 50 60 years and general anxiety</p> <p>disorder disheartened insomnia</p> <p>posttraumatic stress disorder ADHD and</p> <p>what's our primary intervention there</p> <p>are many very good therapists and</p> <p>psychiatrists but over all drugs tend to</p> <p>be the first resort and the drugs are</p> <p>shoot the messenger because these are</p> <p>symptoms of a mind that is not balanced</p> <p>and instead of balancing the mind we</p> <p>smother the symptoms so in very</p> <p>important ways I think we're living in a</p> <p>dark age right now a Dark Age about the</p> <p>nature and the potentials of the mind</p> <p>the source of eudaimonia the sources of</p> <p>true suffering and we're smothering it</p> <p>with work entertainment and drugs that's</p> <p>not a sign of enlightened era it's a</p> <p>sign of an era Dark Age and there's a</p> <p>great contemporary tradition this not a</p> <p>sectarian segment the great contemporary</p> <p>conditions the Sufi the Christian the</p> <p>Buddhist Muslim Taoist and so forth have</p> <p>just a treasure troves of wisdom that we</p> <p>can be drawing on but maybe a nice</p> <p>strong hunch is these content these</p> <p>the traditions each wonderful great in</p> <p>its own right I think they need a kick</p> <p>in the behind from science because</p> <p>religions tend to be complacent</p> <p>self-satisfied dogmatic closed-minded</p> <p>and rigid you know but that's what</p> <p>that's what that's what people do how do</p> <p>the Easter what scientists do that -</p> <p>they fall under the trench of scientific</p> <p>toriel ISM and they don't need an even</p> <p>though they fallen into it they just</p> <p>think they're being scientific science</p> <p>needs to be rescued by the</p> <p>contemplatives and the great contempt uh</p> <p>traditions need to be rescued by science</p> <p>and then we'll see a great union of</p> <p>meaning and truth to the benefit of all</p> <p>without exception so I hope you enjoyed</p> <p>the conversation with Alan Wallace next</p> <p>week we are joined by scholar of Tibetan</p> <p>Buddhism guy Newland who gives us a</p> <p>heartfelt account of the grief journey</p> <p>that he experienced when his wife</p> <p>Valerie passed away I hope you join us</p> <p>for this episode it's so touching and</p> <p>filled with so much wisdom something</p> <p>that is a basis of connection I mean</p> <p>when I talk about in the book this one</p> <p>little situation when I would take</p> <p>Valerie to get chemotherapy and we go to</p> <p>this place at the University of Michigan</p> <p>work everyone was getting chemotherapy</p> <p>and it was like there was some kind of</p> <p>like what do you say not sure there's</p> <p>something peaceful about being in a</p> <p>place where no one's pretending that</p> <p>everything is okay right and this is I</p> <p>think one of the difficulties when</p> <p>people are in the midst of grief or loss</p> <p>is that there's sort of this pressure to</p> <p>maintain the pretense that somehow</p> <p>basically everything is okay</p> <p>so I think almost everybody has when</p> <p>they when they lose somebody important a</p> <p>sense of how hot is it go out the next</p> <p>day</p>

natural state of the ground is free from complexity,</p> <p>And ground-appearances are rigpa-dharmak\u0101ya.</p> <p>The path has always been clear of effort, from the very beginning.</p> <p>When this nature itself is realized, it is the great source of freedom.</p> <p>The fruition is not something separate and set apart.</p> <p>When the result itself is present as cause,</p> <p>Settling completely

The virtuous beginning: the meaning of the introduction</p> <p>II. The virtuous middle: the meaning of the main part</p> <p>III. The virtuous end: the meaning of the conclusion</p> <p>I. The Introduction</p> <p>This has two parts: 1) the meaning of the title, and 2) the expression of homage.</p> <ol> <li>The title</li> </ol> <p>This refers to the line: \u201cThe Vajra Verses on the Natural State.\u201d All phenomena are</p> <p>by nature emptiness, beyond arising, remaining and ceasing. In essence they are</p> <p>primordially pure, like space. Not produced by conditions, they are uncompounded.</p> <p>This has been elaborately explained as the so-called \u201celement\u201d or \u201cbuddha-nature\u201d</p> <p>(sugatagarbha) in the profound secret teachings of the Bliss-gone Teacher, such as</p> <p>the s\u016btras revealing buddha-nature. The King of Sam\u0101dhisays:</p> <p>Pure, pristine, luminous,</p> <p>Unwavering, and unconditioned,</p> <p>This essence of the sugatas</p> <p>Is the nature as it has always been.</p> <p>As this says, the essence of the buddha-nature has always been pure since the very</p> <p>beginning. Adventitious stains have never been part of its primordial condition, so it</p> <p>is by nature pristine and clear, without any impurity. It is not a nihilistic void, but is</p> <p>naturally luminous. As it does not fall into any ontological extreme, such as existing,</p> <p>not existing, and so on, and is beyond any conceptual limitation, it is unwavering.</p> <p>And as it is untainted by conditions, it is unconditioned. The s\u016btras of the middle</p> <p>turning reveal its nature as the 'three gateways of liberation.' As The S\u016btra Requested</p> <p>by Brahm\u0101 says:</p> <p>All phenomena have the nature of emptiness, beyond conceptual reference.</p> <p>All phenomena have the nature of characterlessness, beyond conceptual</p> <p>thought.</p> <p>All phenomena have the nature of wishlessness, beyond acceptance and</p> <p>rejection. 1</p> <p>In the tantras of the uncommon Secret Mantra this is described as the original,</p> <p>primordial ground, or the dharmak\u0101ya rigpa which is present as the ground, and so</p> <p>on. The Precious Treasury of Philosophy says:</p> <p>This original, primordial ground or naturally arising wisdom, which is</p> <p>expansive and beyond limitation or bias, is empty in essence, like the sky. It is</p> <p>clear by nature, like the sun or moon. And it is all-pervasive in its</p> <p>compassionate energy, like rays of light. These three qualities have always</p> <p>been essentially indivisible, as the nature of the three-k\u0101ya wisdom.</p> <p>If we realize this naturally arising wisdom, which is referred to in various ways, then</p> <p>it becomes the basis for nirv\u0101\u1e47a. If we fail to realize it [i.e.naturally arising wisdom],</p> <p>then sa\u1e43s\u0101ra arises. Basic space has always been unconditioned; it is natural and</p> <p>spontaneously present buddhahood. As all the qualities of buddhahood are complete</p> <p>within it, it is the sugata-essence. It is obscured by stains, so it is the ultimate allground (\u0101laya). And in essence it is primordially pure, so it is the wisdom of clear</p> <p>light. As it is beyond any form of limiting projection, such as 'existing' or 'not</p> <p>existing', it is profound emptiness and the view of the Middle Way. As it is free from</p> <p>all conceptual elaboration, it is the transcendent perfection of wisdom</p> <p>(praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101). And as it has always been beyond transition or change, it is</p> <p>suchness.</p> <p>This original natural state of primordial purity, unaltered and ordinary awareness,</p> <p>the open, unimpeded dharmak\u0101ya, or lucid quality of wisdom awareness, is taught to</p> <p>have the nature of the seven vajra qualities. The Omniscient Rangjung Dorje said:</p> <p>It isimpenetrable to the minds of intellectuals.</p> <p>It is impervious to conventional reasoning.</p> <p>It is true, as it accords with the natural state.</p> <p>It is incorruptible, difficult for the unfortunate to fathom.</p> <p>It is stable, its essence being beyond transition or change.</p> <p>It is unimpeded, pervading throughout, and penetrating all, sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and</p> <p>nirv\u0101\u1e47a.</p> <p>It is invincible, as nothing whatsoever can hinder it.</p> <p>The instructions for pointing out directly the nature of this great and universal</p> <p>precursor to both sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a, the dharmak\u0101ya of the original dharmak\u0101ya</p> <p>buddha Samantabhadra are contained here, in these forty lines of infallible vajra</p> <p>speech.</p> <p>2</p> <ol> <li>Expression of Homage</li> </ol> <p>At the beginning of this instruction of the Clear Light Great Perfection, there is an</p> <p>expression of homage to the extraordinary teacher, glorious Samantabhadra, the</p> <p>guide who has no origin or conclusion. He is the all-accomplishing king of wisdom,</p> <p>the Buddha who possesses the three qualities of self-origination: his buddhahood did</p> <p>not originate in the ordinary mind, his instructions did not derive from scriptures,</p> <p>and his fruition did not arise from a cause. To this glorious, original protector, the</p> <p>author offers homage beyond any involvement with the conceptual mind.</p> <p>II. The Main Part</p> <p>This has seven sections: 1) identifying the ground, path and fruition, 2) describing</p> <p>calm abiding and insight, 3) showing rigpa to be the three k\u0101yas, 4) pointing out how</p> <p>this is spontaneously present, 5) showing how view, meditation and action are</p> <p>purified within basic space, 6) the pitfalls to be avoided, and 7) decisive resolution.</p> <ol> <li>Identifying the Ground, Path &amp; Fruition</li> </ol> <p>The natural state of the ground is free from complexity,</p> <p>And ground-appearances are rigpa-dharmak\u0101ya.</p> <p>The path has always been clear of effort, from the very beginning.</p> <p>When this nature itself is made manifest, it is the great source of freedom.</p> <p>The fruition is not something separate and set apart.</p> <p>The natural state of the primordial ground is free from the four or eight conceptual</p> <p>limitations. Anything can arise within the basic space of that intrinsic nature, or 'asit-isness', just as anything can appear in the immaculate surface of a mirror. How is</p> <p>this? In the expanse of clear light, free from centre or circumference, whatever arises</p> <p>dawns as the display of primordial wisdom, without falling into the limited</p> <p>dimensions of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The natural state of the primordial ground is</p> <p>thus beyond all conceptual limitation.</p> <p>\u201cGround-appearances\u201d here refers to the time at which the yogi directly perceives</p> <p>the ground that is superior in its essence to the indeterminate all-ground of impure</p> <p>sa\u1e43s\u0101ric experience. At that time, all clinging and fixation connected with delusory</p> <p>thought is naturally freed, without being rejected, and this is what we call</p> <p>\u201cprimordially pure rigpa.\u201d Then, when the vajra chains of awareness, which appear</p> <p>as the unceasing radiance of spontaneous presence, are seen directly as objects of</p> <p>sensory perception, that is \u201cseeing the dharmak\u0101ya\u201d. A Dzogchen tantra says, \u201cChild</p> <p>of noble family, if you wish to look into the face of dharmak\u0101ya, become familiar</p> <p>with the vajra chains that are rigpa's radiance.\u201d</p> <p>The line \u201cThe path has always...etc.\u201d refers to the fact that this ground and its</p> <p>ground-appearances are unconditioned. They are not dependent on other</p> <p>3</p> <p>conditioned factors. The line shows that on the path, within the basic space that is</p> <p>free from effort and striving, the very consciousness that would eliminate or</p> <p>cultivate temporary risings has always been pure, from the very beginning.</p> <p>When the primordially pure rigpa of the path stage is realized directly and freedom</p> <p>becomes extensive, there is awakening within the expanse of great primordial purity,</p> <p>the basic space that is the ultimate source of freedom.</p> <p>These qualities of ground, path and fruition are not isolated from one another like</p> <p>separate tent dwellings. As the Uttaratantra puts it:</p> <p>As it was before, so it is thereafter,</p> <p>For it is, by its very nature, changeless.</p> <ol> <li>Calm Abiding &amp; Insight</li> </ol> <p>When the fruition itself is present as cause,</p> <p>Settling completely is calm abiding (\u015bamatha).</p> <p>Any sudden rising is rigpa's own radiance,</p> <p>And vivid awareness is insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101).</p> <p>Directly, upon fading, there's primordial experience.</p> <p>When the ultimate fruition is not yet manifest, but is present as a cause, the stillness</p> <p>that comes from allowing any rising thoughts to settle completely is calm abiding</p> <p>(\u015bamatha). This is likened to an ocean free from waves. Any thought which arises all</p> <p>of a sudden through the radiance or expressive power of the real nature is the</p> <p>radiance of rigpa. When we are vividly aware of this, that is what we call \u201cnaturally</p> <p>arising wisdom\u201d, or the \u201cwisdom of clear insight\u201d (vipa\u015byan\u0101). As all thoughts are</p> <p>nakedly freed, and fade into the basic space of the dharmadh\u0101tu, this brings about</p> <p>primordial experience, in which we remain.</p> <ol> <li>How Rigpa is the Three K\u0101yas</li> </ol> <p>Remaining genuinely is the dharmak\u0101ya,</p> <p>Accompanying awareness is the sambhogak\u0101ya,</p> <p>Stillness and movement, non-dual, is the nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya.</p> <p>This is what we call the \u201cthree-k\u0101ya rigpa.\u201d</p> <p>The first line refers to remaining genuinely in the uncontrived wisdom mind of</p> <p>primordial purity, in which phenomena dissolve, the natural state of the ground,</p> <p>beyond confinement and liberation. When this 'ordinary' state of awareness is</p> <p>recognized just as it is, without 'changing its fur' or 'altering its colour', then, as it is</p> <p>untainted by apparent objects externally and unspoilt by the clinging mind within,</p> <p>that is direct realization of the wisdom of dharmak\u0101ya, rigpa-emptiness. The fact</p> <p>that the spontaneous radiance, which is unceasing and the ground out of which</p> <p>4</p> <p>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a unfold, is not blocked, but arises, while we are aware of it, is</p> <p>what we call the sambhogak\u0101ya. Even though the expressive power (rtsal) of</p> <p>compassionate energy arises as objects, if thoughts vanish without trace, so that</p> <p>there is no opportunity for habitual tendencies to form, and arising and liberation</p> <p>occur simultaneously, then we come to master the great wisdom in which there is no</p> <p>division between stillness and movement. The ceaseless arising of the display from</p> <p>the king-like dharmak\u0101ya beyond transference is said to be the nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya. The</p> <p>\u201cthree-k\u0101ya rigpa\u201d is what we call the inseparability of these qualities.</p> <ol> <li>How this is spontaneously present</li> </ol> <p>While remaining at ease, there's no clinging to experience.</p> <p>Vivid movements of mind are freed, ungraspable.</p> <p>Liberated in vivid clarity, there's no post-meditative state of mind.</p> <p>This is what we call the \u201cspontaneously present three k\u0101yas.\u201d</p> <p>When the mind's 'knot' of dualistic grasping is released and undone the essence of</p> <p>the primordially pure ground is beyond labelling or identification. It is unfathomable</p> <p>by the conceptual mind and inexpressible by words. It is beyond any objective</p> <p>reference that could be described, and the one who might describe it is no longer</p> <p>present. Even if one were to remain in this experience of all-penetrating, unimpeded</p> <p>dharmak\u0101ya, the wisdom that is beyond the limiting confines of hope and fear,</p> <p>uninterruptedly day and night, still it would not feature the slightest thought of</p> <p>attachment to itself. The Omniscient Longchenpa put it like this:</p> <p>When perfecting realization of genuine primordial purity,</p> <p>There is no one who wishes for such realization,</p> <p>And in the realization itself, there is no conceit.</p> <p>The yogi of illusion is thus beyond compare.</p> <p>When movement of mind, which arises vividly through the expressive power of</p> <p>spontaneous presence, is freed by itself, it is beyond identification. As the Thalgyur</p> <p>says:</p> <p>Free from the beginning, there is no basis for repetition.</p> <p>Freed by itself, there is no antidote.</p> <p>Nakedly free, it vanishes as it is seen.</p> <p>As this says, in 'naked freedom' whatever thoughts arise, whether subtle or more</p> <p>apparent, are liberated with mere recognition, through the crucial point of their</p> <p>absence of any real essence. This is compared to meeting an old acquaintance. 'Selffreedom' means that, based on the crucial point of the absence of any antidote,</p> <p>whatever thoughts arise come into being automatically and are freed automatically,</p> <p>like a snake unwinding its own knots. 'Primordial freedom' means remaining in the</p> <p>primordial nature. Based on the crucial point of the absence of any basis for</p> <p>5</p> <p>repetition, the naturally abiding ground has nothing to lose and nothing to gain. This</p> <p>freedom which is beyond benefit and harm is illustrated by a thief entering an empty</p> <p>house. Furthermore, it is also said, \u201cFreed upon arising, there is no before and no</p> <p>after.\u201d As this indicates, when whatever arises in the mind is clearly freed within the</p> <p>space of the dharmadh\u0101tu, it is like the example of writing on water. Just as writing</p> <p>and its disappearance occur at the same time, arising and liberation occur</p> <p>simultaneously for whatever thoughts appear. And, according to the Omniscient</p> <p>King of Dharma, this uninterrupted process of spontaneous arising and spontaneous</p> <p>liberation is a special feature of the Natural Great Perfection.</p> <p>From the perspective of meditative equipoise, in which one does not waver from this</p> <p>natural essence of primordial purity, one is freed from the five aggregates, and even</p> <p>in the post-meditation of the unceasing radiance of spontaneous presence one is</p> <p>untainted by the eight ordinary modes of consciousness. With no distinction</p> <p>between meditation and post-meditation, the name 'post-meditative state' does not</p> <p>apply. Like a traveller arriving at the fabled island of jewels who might search for</p> <p>ordinary earth and stones but will never find them, once we reach a point at which</p> <p>all that rises in the mind becomes the display of primordial wisdom, even though we</p> <p>might search for instances of ordinary delusion we will not find them. At this stage,</p> <p>all phenomena based upon dualistic perception are freed by themselves, even</p> <p>without being rejected. Like last night's darkness, which vanishes spontaneously and</p> <p>without trace in the light of the rising sun, dualistic perception disappears, even if</p> <p>we can not say where it is that it goes. As the vajra \u1e0d\u0101kin\u012b said, \u201cFor the yogi free</p> <p>from limitation, like the dawning of the sun, this is the experience of dharmak\u0101ya.</p> <p>Emaho!\u201d Indeed, if you realize this, it is what we call \u201cthe spontaneously present,</p> <p>unaltered yoga in which the three k\u0101yas are experienced on the path.\u201d</p> <ol> <li>How view, meditation and conduct are purified within basic space</li> </ol> <p>Without any deliberate view, it is beyond dullness and agitation.</p> <p>Without deliberate meditation, it is entering the original 'womb'.</p> <p>Without deliberate conduct, it is free from rigid notions or ideas.</p> <p>One who has mastered this is a \u201clord among yogis.\u201d</p> <p>When gaining this kind of realization, there is no dualistic division into an object to</p> <p>be viewed and the mindfulness that is the viewer. Moreover, it is free from dullness</p> <p>caused by the diminishing of awareness's clarity and the agitation of thoughts</p> <p>directed towards objects. The fact that meditative concentration with a particular</p> <p>focus does not lead to enlightenment is explained in The Lion's Perfect Power:</p> <p>Practising meditative concentration you will not see the meaning of</p> <p>dharmat\u0101.</p> <p>Naturally present absorption (sam\u0101dhi) is free from any deliberative position.</p> <p>Free from conceptual mind, the natural state is equal to the limits of space. 6</p> <p>There is no thought through which objects of reference might be perceived.</p> <p>As this indicates, there is not the tiniest speck of meditation to be cultivated, and this</p> <p>is known as \u201centering the original womb.\u201d</p> <p>When this kind of realization unfolds, it is free of something to meditate on and one</p> <p>who settles in meditation. It is also beyond any particular form of conduct related to</p> <p>post-meditation, as one is beyond all fixed notions or ideas about rejecting or</p> <p>cultivating the phenomena of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a.</p> <p>Anyone who masters the wisdom of rigpa in the genuine state</p> <p>1 of the ultimate</p> <p>nature and who consequently gains power over all the phenomena of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and</p> <p>nirv\u0101\u1e47a in their equalness, is what we would call a great lord among siddhas.</p> <ol> <li>Pitfalls to be Avoided</li> </ol> <p>If you are aware of a thought as it suddenly appears,</p> <p>And can sustain the continuity of recognition,</p> <p>That is insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101) gone astray in character.</p> <p>It can also be referred to as \u201cpost-meditation.\u201d</p> <p>But it's not the freeing of thoughts as dharmak\u0101ya,</p> <p>And we must cut directly to the source.</p> <p>While the mind remains in empty clarity, if you are aware of a thought suddenly</p> <p>appearing and you sustain that continuity, this is the insight that errs in terms of</p> <p>character. It is not genuine insight. It would be fine to label it with the term 'postmeditation'. It is not a state in which whatever thoughts arise are freed as</p> <p>dharmak\u0101ya. Rather, whatever mental afflictions occur first arise as an object, are</p> <p>then noticed with pure awareness or mindfulness, and are finally left to settle in</p> <p>their own place. But this is merely the approach of purifying movement so that</p> <p>thoughts become objectless and without root. What is needed is to cut directly to the</p> <p>source, so that, through the crucial point of freedom in the dharmat\u0101 nature itself,</p> <p>whatever afflictions and thoughts arise do not hold firm, but disintegrate, freed by</p> <p>their very nature in simultaneous arising and liberation.</p> <ol> <li>Decisive Resolution</li> </ol> <p>Rigpa has always been free from conceptual elaboration.</p> <p>Conventions such as 'view', 'meditation' or 'conduct' and</p> <p>Any clinging to them is cleared, without basis or origin.</p> <p>Good thoughts, bad thoughts, and those in between,</p> <p>Without slipping into any such categorization,</p> <p>Are freed upon arising, without any agent to make distinctions.</p> <p>As long as awareness does not lose its own ground,</p> <p>There is no need for anything more than this. 7</p> <p>In order to show how this 'ordinary' rigpa has always been free from conceptual</p> <p>elaboration from the very beginning, the text points out how the conventions of</p> <p>'view', 'meditation' and 'conduct' are like mere impressions. No matter how the</p> <p>unobstructed radiance of rigpa arises, delusory perception is cleared by itself,</p> <p>without any basis or foundation for clinging to it. When it arises as positive thoughts</p> <p>they arise spontaneously and are freed spontaneously. And when it arises as</p> <p>negative thoughts they become the vast expanse free from all limitations. When</p> <p>remaining in the same state, even neutral thoughts vanish by themselves. Not falling</p> <p>into any position related to existence or non-existence, and without considering</p> <p>there to be an agent separate from freedom upon arising, maintain unaltered</p> <p>'ordinary' consciousness, the inexpressible state of awareness and emptiness. If this</p> <p>does not lose its own ground, there is no need for any further, supposedly greater</p> <p>form of view or meditation.</p> <p>III.

Vipashyana is the direct, experiential insight that all experience does indeed appear, yet cannot be captured by words and concepts, and so is fundamentally as ungraspable and groundless as space.</p>"},{"location":"docs_2020/videos/vipassana/#instructions","title":"instructions","text":"<p>dudjom lingpa - taking appearances and awareness as the path</p> <ul> <li>appearances</li> <li>awareness</li> </ul> <p>use radically empirical observation</p> <p>this one's a single pointed body scan</p> <ol> <li> <p>second law of thermodynamics states particles end in chaos (entropy)\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"docs_2021/","title":"\ud83d\ude4f buddhism \ud83d\udd49\ufe0f","text":"<p>this is a microsite with my research on meditation, buddhism, minimalism, hindusim and related subjects.</p> <p>my goal is to maintain meditative awareness levels at all times, not just when i'm on a cushion in a shrine</p> <p>throughout the day i try to recognize rigpa, some call this non meditation.</p> <p>i do the same slightly differently when i go to sleep </p> <p>this site has some old notes i need to clean up</p> <p>currently i'm reading &amp; taking notes on the book as it is vol 1</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/ccr/","title":"center for contemplative research","text":"<p>This is probably my biggest interest.</p> <p>center for contemplative research</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/log/","title":"log","text":"<p>2021-02-25</p> <p>the best concise instructions i've seen are urgyens thought free video and this one - naturally liberating whatever you meet</p> <p>and there are some big nuggets in this one</p> <p>and a few instructions i would call faith based nihilism</p> <p>once you get into deep water everyone talks about the \"non conceptual\", for example saying that we are infinite and eternal, those two experiences in the context of this universe overlap delusion</p> <p>2021-02-22</p> <p>as it is vol 1 page 108</p> <pre><code>remember to recognize mind essence: \"What is it that imagines this? What is\nit that thinks this?\"\n</code></pre> <pre><code>I'm going to talk a little more about practicing the development\nstage as an imitation of the real thing, as a mere resemblance. At some\npoint in a sadhana there is the mantra \nOM MAHA SHUNYATA JNANA VAJRA SVABHAVA ATMA KOH HANG. \nThe syllable OM is the nature of all form, and it expresses \nthat everything perceived is Buddha Vairochana, the emptiness of all form. \nMAHA SHUNYATA means great emptiness.\nJNANA means original wakefulness, emptiness and cognizance indivisible. In essence, when one recites\nIn essence, when one recites the mantra one is saying, \"I am of the\nnature of indestructible wakefulness in which everything perceived is a\ngreat emptiness.\"\nThen, after a few seconds, one says, \"From this state of emptiness,\nin one instant, I appear in the form of the deity.\"\n</code></pre> <p>p 118</p> <pre><code>There are four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism: \nKagyii, Sakya, Nyingma and Geluk. In all four of these traditions, when we practice\ndevelopment stage, we need to start with the samadhi of suchness.\nSuchness means the innate nature of your own mind. It is not some\nother suchness from some other place. That suchness is simply the\ncompletion stage. The complete in completion means what is completely\npresent as your own nature, which is the dharmakaya nature of mind.\nTo recognize that is called completion stage. While recognizing mind\nessence, while remaining in the samadhi of suchness, one allows the\nvisualizations of the development stage to take place without leaving\nthe natural state behind. Out of the expanse of the three kayas, the\npractice of sadhana takes place for the benefit of beings. Both samsara\nand nirvana always manifest out of the expanse of the three kayas.\nThe first of the three samadhis, the samadhi of suchness, means\nprimordial emptiness. It is actually the essence of the kayas of all\nns \nbuddhas. The empty essence is the quality of enlightened body. The\ncognizant nature is the quality of enlightened speech. The unconfined\ncapacity of awareness is the quality of enlightened mind.\n</code></pre> <p>2021-01-24</p> <p>koans</p> <p>2021-01-22</p> <p>2021-01-05</p> <p>I've narrowed down and rearanged the order of the books / practices I'm studying and taking notes, after these notes make sense I will publish them here.</p> <ul> <li>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche - several books I've ordered and am reading currently</li> <li>Lerab Lingpa - Open Mind</li> <li>Dudjom Lingpa - Vajra Essence</li> </ul>"},{"location":"docs_2021/log/#rando-notes","title":"rando notes","text":"<ul> <li>this entie site is a draft, it grows then shrinks regularly as i attempt to grasp this subject<ul> <li>i've only studied buddhism for a few years and specifically dzogchen, amazon sells 700 books on dzogchen, that is far too many so my main goal with this project is to sift through and find the most meaningful and see if i can achieve the claims people make for it in this lifetime</li> <li>wish me luck \u2764</li> </ul> </li> <li>checkout the centre for contemplate research</li> <li>my daily habits</li> <li>deity research</li> <li>Vajrayana can end widespread ignorance and replace it with compassion &amp;

it turned out</p> <p>he was a Buddhist monk and a fascinating</p> <p>person he lived in Nepali live with</p> <p>Tibetans and I learned all of this in</p> <p>about ten minutes because he took me</p> <p>about ten minutes down the road and then</p> <p>dropped me off because he lived in a</p> <p>chalet up in the mountain but he learned</p> <p>I was introduced in Buddhism we</p> <p>correspond 84 years after that but that</p> <p>was that was kind of a wake-up call</p> <p>because 1970 how many Buddhist monks</p> <p>were there in Europe I think you</p> <p>probably count them on one maximum two</p> <p>hands and he came right when I called</p> <p>and it kind of made me feel well there</p> <p>are coincidence and then there are</p> <p>coincidences and there's a point which</p> <p>to say coincidence is just stupid and</p> <p>this seemed to be one of the stupid</p> <p>times just to say that yeah well it</p> <p>happens yeah it did that was really a</p> <p>coincidence but then when I followed you</p> <p>know when I kept on I went down to</p> <p>Gooding and find there was a vesting</p> <p>Lama we just been appointed by the Dalai</p> <p>Lama to be unfactored he with him went</p> <p>after Switzerland trained there for a</p> <p>few months for the summer and there my</p> <p>safe but bought myself a one-way ticket</p> <p>to India and immerse myself in the next</p> <p>four years but what in short of the what</p> <p>really pulled me was on the one had a</p> <p>very deep intuitive sense of zopi in</p> <p>which I didn't understand I just felt</p> <p>this is it and it was 20 years before</p> <p>circumstances came together for me to</p> <p>really have an opportunity to immerse</p> <p>myself in the study and practices Oh</p> <p>Kenneth 1990 with garuda mochi until</p> <p>then it was Olga Luba tera vaada Sakia</p> <p>but it was but on a more cognitive level</p> <p>I found here a tradition that was not</p> <p>simply religion</p> <p>simply science not simply philosophy it</p> <p>includes all three elements but what</p> <p>really caught me and then it's helped me</p> <p>ever since is here is a path of ever</p> <p>deepening meaning but also ever</p> <p>deepening insight understanding</p> <p>knowledge and they're all bound into one</p> <p>wisdom and skillful means you could say</p> <p>and that's been enormously can tell me</p> <p>for me so you went to India basically in</p> <p>search of meaning you had facts from the</p> <p>science side of things so you're looking</p> <p>for meaning but then you end up coming</p> <p>back to the states and

German</p> <p>scholar it was trained for years I met</p> <p>him years later in 1980 it's an</p> <p>outstanding it's still a classic and it</p> <p>covers the mahasabha Pat Tomasulo an</p> <p>excellent commentary to it I read that</p> <p>and it just read on my own I had no</p> <p>teacher but I thought I can practice</p> <p>that this really makes sense and it was</p> <p>not just meaning if somebody wanted</p> <p>meaning I could have maybe tried to just</p> <p>adopt some aberrant form of Christianity</p> <p>and you know be a good heretical</p> <p>Christian but I was looking for insight</p> <p>for understanding for knowledge and here</p> <p>the satipatthana sutra decided a ton of</p> <p>practice before our closed applications</p> <p>of mindfulness that's just that in</p> <p>is that is it's tremendously meaningful</p> <p>and yet it's so smart it's so sharp it's</p> <p>intelligent it's radically empirical and</p> <p>so I immerse myself and started</p> <p>practicing that in 1970 on my own in</p> <p>Germany and then bought myself a one-way</p> <p>ticket to India and so then when you</p> <p>came back and started at Amherst I'm</p> <p>wondering what was the thought why why</p> <p>after spending four years in Dharamsala</p> <p>you know meeting all these llamas I</p> <p>think I get you up tonight he's on insta</p> <p>llama and then you come back and then</p> <p>there's this pull back into academia and</p> <p>I was wondering what would the</p> <p>motivation behind that was sure well it</p> <p>was more than four years I was in</p> <p>Dharamsala from 71 to 75 had tremendous</p> <p>and repeated health problems one after</p> <p>another three cases of hepatitis I think</p> <p>I got typhoid I had three types of worms</p> <p>the list goes on and on it was</p> <p>physically very very tough and mentally</p> <p>and spiritually just a feast I mean it</p> <p>was terrific but also really took a lot</p> <p>of wear and tear on the body and then by</p> <p>that time that by 1971 I had a personal</p> <p>connection with His Holiness Dalai Lama</p> <p>he was my husband is and will be my root</p> <p>guru since 71 and so after been there</p> <p>and I was I received my four-nation from</p> <p>him since 1975 just a few months after</p> <p>my ordination with him full ordination</p> <p>then I met with him because my teacher</p> <p>who gave me my novice ordination two</p> <p>years earlier had been posted to become</p> <p>abbot of the monastery the Recon</p> <p>monastery and journey in Switzerland and</p> <p>again my second home so I met with him</p> <p>and and just simply simply asked him</p> <p>where can I be of greatest benefit shall</p> <p>I stay here in Dharamsala continue</p> <p>meditating and so on</p> <p>I toured also spent more than a year in</p> <p>the Buddhist school dialectics so it had</p> <p>fairly rigorous training there so I</p> <p>should shall I stay here in Dharamsala</p> <p>or shall I accompany my teacher back to</p> <p>Switzerland by then I was fluent in</p> <p>Tibetan my kid services interpreter</p> <p>continued my own training and to</p> <p>whatever is helpful and he said go west</p> <p>young man</p> <p>and so in 1975 then I went back to</p> <p>Switzerland spent four and a half years</p> <p>there a translating for him eventually I</p> <p>was teaching I was translating writing</p> <p>practicing</p> <p>after about nine or ten years by the</p> <p>time I got to the end of the 70s it</p> <p>would been had been pretty intensive</p> <p>training lots and lots of teaching</p> <p>including a good dose of tera vaada</p> <p>which I received from one monk who came</p> <p>to dance alone I study with him</p> <p>intensely for a summer maybe a bit more</p> <p>but then after night by the United end</p> <p>of 1979 I just felt kind of saturated</p> <p>with undigested knowledge but not that</p> <p>I'd understood but not assimilated so I</p> <p>wrote to his holiness and said all I</p> <p>want to do now is meditate for a while</p> <p>and where shall I go shall I go back to</p> <p>America stay in Switzerland to come back</p> <p>to India and he said come to Mindy I'll</p> <p>teach you I'll teach you meditation I</p> <p>didn't take long to decide what to do</p> <p>and so I spent the next four years from</p> <p>beginning of 1984 through three end of</p> <p>1983 basically just in a series of</p> <p>meditative retreats in India Sri Lanka</p> <p>Insight Meditation Society right here in</p> <p>Boston you are outside of Boston Manor</p> <p>and living in the breakers out in</p> <p>Arizona and so on for years than just</p> <p>just meditating and by that time I had</p> <p>really been out of the mainstream of</p> <p>Western civilization for thirteen years</p> <p>and I would often say not really ingest</p> <p>but I was born at the age of 20 I just</p> <p>flew in like with my pals in Hindi or</p> <p>Switzerland so forth I would say I was</p> <p>born at the age of 20 because that's the</p> <p>the age at which things started making</p> <p>sense and before that first 20 years was</p> <p>a drumroll to actually having in a</p> <p>beginning when I thought was a</p> <p>meaningful life but by the time I was</p> <p>2033 almost 34 then I just thought I</p> <p>went to Asia and I immersed myself in</p> <p>Tibetan culture and primarily in</p> <p>buddhadharma to seek integration to live</p> <p>a whole and meaningful and truthful life</p> <p>integrating meaning and wisdom insight</p> <p>knowledge and what I done in the process</p> <p>is completely bifurcate myself into the</p> <p>first twenty years in the last 14 and</p> <p>had alienated myself from my own culture</p> <p>so I felt a stranger in my own home and</p> <p>completely doesn't continue my Western</p> <p>education and I thought well maybe now</p> <p>after 14 years of quite thorough</p> <p>immersion in a very different culture</p> <p>and whole spiritual tradition</p> <p>maybe it's time to integrate to begin</p> <p>integrating and so I was accepted at</p> <p>Amherst College to wish I was there an</p> <p>enormous privilege it's an outstanding</p> <p>college and that was in 84 and decided</p> <p>to study physics because I've have</p> <p>thought here here's the paradigm here's</p> <p>the here's the the template for Western</p> <p>Sciences the whole Galileo started it</p> <p>and all the other branches of science</p> <p>suffer from physics Envy I've been told</p> <p>you know emulating this tremendous</p> <p>success story of physics going back to</p> <p>Copernicus Kepler Galileo Newton and on</p> <p>there is science at its most dazzling</p> <p>one can say from my perspective and so</p> <p>why not study that you know and then and</p> <p>do all the hard work does that do the</p> <p>mathematics do from classical mechanics</p> <p>and electromagnetism all the way through</p> <p>but what I was really curious about was</p> <p>quantum mechanics and so I thought if</p> <p>there's going to be some real meaningful</p> <p>engagement between modern physics and</p> <p>the Buddhist tradition which I get I've</p> <p>been trained by them for 14 years I</p> <p>thought it's gonna be here quantum</p> <p>mechanics because this is now</p> <p>challenging a lot of the absolutes that</p> <p>pervaded classical physics absolute</p> <p>space time matter energy so I won't</p> <p>elaborate in quantum mechanics but I was</p> <p>very intrigued and so that's what I did</p> <p>Adam Martin a marvelous mentor one was</p> <p>named I'm glad to mention Arthur Zions</p> <p>he remains one of my dearest friends and</p> <p>he really took me under his wing he</p> <p>guided me through my training and</p> <p>history of physics philosophy of science</p> <p>quantum mechanics and with Bob Thurman</p> <p>I studied Sanskrit and I wrote a 500</p> <p>page thesis and left a very happy camper</p> <p>how old are you at this stage 36 when I</p> <p>graduate Wow so you fit so much in</p> <p>already and and at that time you were</p> <p>studying you were still I think you were</p> <p>still you know getting teachings I think</p> <p>you've met up with Ganley marimba and</p> <p>you were also going out to the</p> <p>California desert and doing retreats and</p> <p>all this all these kind of things and so</p> <p>I'm wondering I was wondering</p> <p>particularly about Ganley marimba and</p> <p>he's rumored to have a Qi</p> <p>chanita and I was wondering if where</p> <p>your interest in geometry practice came</p> <p>from and whether he was an influence on</p> <p>you in that regard</p> <p>yeah so during my years two-and-a-half</p> <p>years yet Amherst</p> <p>they gave me two semesters and I was</p> <p>writing a very big thesis why asking for</p> <p>one more semester because I was full</p> <p>scholarship I came out without that</p> <p>without debt which is enormous</p> <p>I have enormous gratitude for Emmer's</p> <p>for that so I spent five semesters there</p> <p>and during that time I was still</p> <p>ordained I was a monk so as a Buddhist</p> <p>monk studying physics mathematics</p> <p>history of science philosophy of science</p> <p>but an incognito monk and then when I</p> <p>graduated all I wanted to do is go off</p> <p>into retreating him so I went slipped</p> <p>off to the Eastern Sierra the high</p> <p>desert of the Eastern Sierra Nevada</p> <p>mountains in California and was there</p> <p>for about a year and in the meantime</p> <p>back in 1980 when I when a solon is</p> <p>invited me back to India to meditate I</p> <p>was given by a truly marvelous Tibetan</p> <p>yogi by the name again Shama wanted old</p> <p>friends with lama zopa rinpoche and I</p> <p>remember so forth again Shama Wondrich</p> <p>was a yogi yogi and he moved into gates</p> <p>or uplands empty cabin left his cabin</p> <p>vacant so he invited me to do my retreat</p> <p>in his cabin and so at that time one of</p> <p>the Yogi's Tibetan Yogi's living at</p> <p>there about an hour and a half hike</p> <p>above McLeod Ganj about Dharamsala one</p> <p>of the Yogi's living up there was gama</p> <p>marimba and he allowed me to come and</p> <p>drop in on him once a week just for me</p> <p>to consult with him about my practice</p> <p>his holiness with guiding my practice</p> <p>but he had a few other things to do with</p> <p>his time besides guide me so I couldn't</p> <p>just drop in on him whenever I wanted to</p> <p>is given I'm River was more available so</p> <p>I would see his holiness whenever I</p> <p>could began my remember I got to know</p> <p>quite well and developed a real</p> <p>friendship with him at a very deep sense</p> <p>of reverence and respect it's just a</p> <p>tremendous you'll be a wonderful monk</p> <p>scholar and contemplative so we got to</p> <p>know each other that way and then after</p> <p>I'd finished up at Amherst and that was</p> <p>in 86 then with a bit of preparation and</p> <p>I asked His Holiness</p> <p>whether he would allow Gemma if young</p> <p>member of wish to come whether he be</p> <p>willing to come and lead a one-year</p> <p>shamah to retreat a group retreat</p> <p>because I've been teaching in Seattle</p> <p>for some time at that point and aroused</p> <p>a certain amount of interest in this and</p> <p>he consulted with His Holiness his own</p> <p>and has told him yes it would be good</p> <p>idea to come so he came for all of 1970</p> <p>1988 1988 he led and I was kind of his</p> <p>apprentice a one-year shamah to retreat</p> <p>for 12 people and it went very very well</p> <p>everybody in the retreat said it was the</p> <p>most meaningful year of their lives but</p> <p>in terms of mine in the first teacher</p> <p>the first Lama from whom I received</p> <p>sustained and very rigorous training was</p> <p>cashing home anti-gay because I went to</p> <p>Dharma Zala expressly because under the</p> <p>auspices of His Holiness Dalai Lama the</p> <p>Tibetan works the Tibetan light come</p> <p>library of Tibetan worked in archives</p> <p>had just opened the doors and they were</p> <p>they held a one-year course in Buddhism</p> <p>and so I went from Switzerland to to</p> <p>Dharamsala because of that course I was</p> <p>studying with a sakya lama in</p> <p>Switzerland and I wanted to go to Nepal</p> <p>and find a cave with some yogi in it</p> <p>they take one look at me and say my</p> <p>chela my chela you know leading me to</p> <p>enlightenment</p> <p>but this bulletin came from Dharamsala</p> <p>and my sakya lama in switzerland said go</p> <p>there so I just made a beeline there but</p> <p>caching anti-gay when he was teaching he</p> <p>taught all of lamrim I taught the guide</p> <p>to the Bodhisattva way of life he also</p> <p>taught the abyss AMA alankara or the</p> <p>ornament for the Ottoman for clear</p> <p>realization and in all of these</p> <p>teachings including shantideva shaman is</p> <p>there I mean it's very explicitly there</p> <p>and I remember very vividly I don't want</p> <p>to go on too long here I remember very</p> <p>vividly when again when getting on Tiger</p> <p>we're teaching Islam remain you got to</p> <p>the schemata just before the passion of</p> <p>course he said well why don't we</p> <p>practice a little bit</p> <p>he'd be teaching as you know the by the</p> <p>book and then he said well let's</p> <p>practice of it so there's just eight of</p> <p>us and this one year of course and so</p> <p>he's so I'm up for it you know so we sat</p> <p>there and he sat like there's like a</p> <p>stone Buddha and after 20 minutes I and</p> <p>I think the others in our class were</p> <p>getting getting fidgety and</p> <p>uncomfortable and half an hour goes by</p> <p>getting more uncomfortable an hour wind</p> <p>by he's not moving a muscle and then</p> <p>we're in physic</p> <p>agony and two hours goes by and three</p> <p>hours go by by that time we're basically</p> <p>internally scream our heads off were so</p> <p>much pain and then in a gift moment I</p> <p>get gently opened his eyes look at us</p> <p>and said Shawn that is not so easy so</p> <p>but he said many things that really</p> <p>captured my attention he said you know</p> <p>if you've achieved summer to them the</p> <p>passion is easy and when he was teaching</p> <p>us the abysm alankara this definitive</p> <p>presentation of the five paths starting</p> <p>with the path of accumulation</p> <p>culminating associate rock our Heartland</p> <p>by the Sante path as a buddha according</p> <p>to the lineage in which he was trained</p> <p>which I received if you want to reach</p> <p>just the first path well the the crucial</p> <p>element is you so deeply cultivate</p> <p>bodhichitta that arises spontaneously</p> <p>effortlessly but for that to happen your</p> <p>mind has to be wonderfully stable fit</p> <p>free of the by Box curations and for</p> <p>that you have to achieve schemata</p> <p>achieve shaman not just work at it but</p> <p>you should have achieved schemata which</p> <p>indicates a very very exceptional degree</p> <p>of mental health and balance and with</p> <p>that basis you cultivate bodhichitta to</p> <p>the point that there rises spontaneously</p> <p>and then you reach the path and so I</p> <p>listen to that mr. boat that's the most</p> <p>important thing to do and it was</p> <p>actually oddly enough it was a reason</p> <p>for me leaving after about a year and a</p> <p>half my formal monastic training was on</p> <p>the track to becoming a Geisha because</p> <p>I'd receive all the basic training and</p> <p>logic and debate and Buddhist psychology</p> <p>and and so forth and we are just about</p> <p>to begin</p> <p>six years of training six years</p> <p>continuously of the other semi alankara</p> <p>which we'd exhaustively in detail study</p> <p>the five Madiga as if I've passed the</p> <p>1000 Bodhisattva Bloomie's but there</p> <p>came a little interference on this</p> <p>trajectory and that is who inca the wink</p> <p>at the burmese meditation master he was</p> <p>invited to Dharamsala to lead his 10-day</p> <p>retreat and his holiness told all of us</p> <p>in a monastery we should all go and so</p> <p>well then you go your route Lama I just</p> <p>said go so it and so there I was in</p> <p>going cos we treat starting it like for</p> <p>in the morning meditating 11 hours a day</p> <p>and in in these 10 days I looked at my</p> <p>mind and it was like an enormous garbage</p> <p>dump that was alive with living garbage</p> <p>you know just so much noise and</p> <p>agitation and imbalances and so forth</p> <p>and I looked at this and after about</p> <p>eight or nine days of this I said what</p> <p>would I be doing studying the five paths</p> <p>and the ten are you put us after boonies</p> <p>when I can't even see the bottom edge of</p> <p>the lowest path because I'm Way down</p> <p>here and so why don't I just drew</p> <p>everything I possibly can to try to</p> <p>reach the first path but this means I</p> <p>don't need detailed knowledge of the</p> <p>five paths and the ten boomys I just</p> <p>need to learn how to become a bit saner</p> <p>so with His Holiness permission I</p> <p>dropped out and once again I drop out</p> <p>dropped out of Western a key to me and I</p> <p>dropped out of eastern academia and just</p> <p>often meditated it's all I wanted to do</p> <p>and then so that was so that led to four</p> <p>years of retreat from 80 to 84 and then</p> <p>gallim Rimba came in 1988 and then he</p> <p>caught the Shama to a retreat and it</p> <p>just struck me ever since that this is</p> <p>something that is universally important</p> <p>in Buddhism Theravada but and perfectly</p> <p>clear and in any school of Buddhist you</p> <p>have Sheila Samadhi flat yeah you can't</p> <p>skip Samadhi</p> <p>don't blow it off a momentary samadhi</p> <p>that's a gimmick Samadhi is more among</p> <p>more than just a little momentary</p> <p>business it's something quite serious</p> <p>and in the - in the my Anna and the vaad</p> <p>Rihanna everywhere Sean that is</p> <p>everywhere cropping up and yet to my</p> <p>astonishment as the years went by is</p> <p>seen that it was either overlooked</p> <p>marginalized or tore trivialized and so</p> <p>it just struck me this is a missing</p> <p>piece so many things are talking well</p> <p>really well in the Terracotta tradition</p> <p>the charm is in all schools in Tibetan</p> <p>Buddhism many outstanding teachers and</p> <p>many outstanding teachings and and of</p> <p>course a number of people teach</p> <p>summative but not that many really</p> <p>emphasize it and so I can be taking that</p> <p>to heart</p> <p>so after hearing that I can't help but</p> <p>ask a technical question well you're</p> <p>talking about geometry and bodhichitta</p> <p>and I'm wondering if you think that you</p> <p>have to it's necessary to achieve Shama</p> <p>table before you can achieve bodhichitta</p> <p>yeah the whole notion of achieving</p> <p>bodhichitta by you as a scholar you know</p> <p>this is referring to in the benjamin my</p> <p>and hngg sam uncontrived effortless</p> <p>spontaneously arising bodhichitta such</p> <p>you've cultivated so deeply that it's</p> <p>your more your default mode your ground</p> <p>state and it could be actively triggered</p> <p>by virtually anything and then just</p> <p>Bowditch it is there you know it's a</p> <p>primary mind it's not just an aspiration</p> <p>have once in a while it's like your</p> <p>prime directive and when that sinks so</p> <p>deeply into your psyche almost into your</p> <p>marrow</p> <p>that it's just your your desire of</p> <p>desires for which all other desires are</p> <p>derivative that's when you've achieved</p> <p>bodhichitta and then at that point</p> <p>you're a Buddhist actor so is it</p> <p>necessary to have fully achieved siya</p> <p>matter and by that I mean technically</p> <p>then access to the first jhana because</p> <p>that's that's how the term is used in in</p> <p>the whole intro Tibetan tradition there</p> <p>is scholarly debate on this point in the</p> <p>tradition of getting on Tiger Lama Zopa</p> <p>Rinpoche issue wrapped in the set at the</p> <p>ceviche tradition they say yeah you need</p> <p>to fully achieve da Matta in order to</p> <p>bring about that depth and that degree</p> <p>of spontaneity bodhichitta but other</p> <p>very well very erudite scholars say not</p> <p>entire you don't need to achieve all</p> <p>nine stages you certainly must have a</p> <p>stable mind certainly the five</p> <p>obscurations must be attenuated their</p> <p>beings kind of craving central craving</p> <p>laxity and excitation like laxity and</p> <p>dullness excitation and anxiety and</p> <p>afflictive afflictive uncertainty I</p> <p>think I just and they'll will enmity so</p> <p>those five have to be really in abeyance</p> <p>it's hard to imagine a mind that is very</p> <p>prone to ill-will and animosity in that</p> <p>same mind stream but it's just arising</p> <p>that's kind of like that's not gonna</p> <p>happen</p> <p>so there's scholarly debate whether you</p> <p>need simply a very good degree of</p> <p>Samadhi I mean really good like I'm nine</p> <p>stages leading to schemata okay Stage</p> <p>five given I'm Reba said he told me with</p> <p>doing that one year that I lived with</p> <p>him in 1988 during this one year retreat</p> <p>he said it was not uncommon in the</p> <p>gloopy tradition for very serious Yogi's</p> <p>like himself in terms of schemata just</p> <p>to go up to the fifth</p> <p>out of nine stages sending Appa the</p> <p>fifth of nine stages at that point your</p> <p>course excitation is is through you can</p> <p>sit for an hour maybe longer with an</p> <p>unbroken flow of mindfulness never</p> <p>completely disengaging for a meditative</p> <p>object the mind has reason to be clear</p> <p>you're somebody's pretty darn good and</p> <p>he said it was common in his tradition</p> <p>the glue per tradition to achieve that</p> <p>as a flat Shama to practice focusing on</p> <p>an image of buddha shakyamuni or</p> <p>whatever method you like and then with</p> <p>that degree of samadhi then go right</p> <p>into state regeneration practice and</p> <p>then finish off what you started with in</p> <p>the context of stage of generation</p> <p>practice but in as a point of fact and</p> <p>some couple points this out jujube Ling</p> <p>pointed out the great name a llama llama</p> <p>meet Pomona birch a point out they've</p> <p>all said from the fifteenth century</p> <p>until the present relatively few people</p> <p>actually fully achieve summit most of</p> <p>them seem to be in a hurry well achieve</p> <p>a little bit and then Rob the state</p> <p>regeneration or just do a lamb rim or 13</p> <p>do more they're doing so to Norma mudra</p> <p>they're eager to get to the good stuff</p> <p>and summit is like thinking about summit</p> <p>Hindus do summit how important could</p> <p>that be you know that of sectarian bias</p> <p>comes in or the Indiana they do schemata</p> <p>how come born exactly you know but</p> <p>that's a sectarian talk it is enormous</p> <p>Lee important and there's there's a</p> <p>story from Buddha's own life after he</p> <p>had finished his six years of aesthetic</p> <p>practices damaged his health restored</p> <p>his health and in might recall from the</p> <p>nakaya's then then the Buddha was the</p> <p>gautuma the age of 35 was wondering what</p> <p>now because he had already tried Samadhi</p> <p>tried all these ascetic practices and so</p> <p>forth and then he recalled a time as a</p> <p>youth maybe is 12 13 years old something</p> <p>like that where he was simply sitting</p> <p>quietly under a rose apple tree while</p> <p>his father was out doing some ritual and</p> <p>a royal ritual and he spontaneously</p> <p>slipped into the first Jana just slip</p> <p>right into it since it was drew the 5ox</p> <p>creation went down the mine whose supple</p> <p>it was filled with well-being was his</p> <p>sense of what bliss and so forth and</p> <p>most importantly release fit for action</p> <p>you know supple</p> <p>ha that scent that Sanskrit term</p> <p>supplements malleability and then as</p> <p>it's that cropped up spontaneously then</p> <p>when the Risha was over he had to get on</p> <p>with his life then it also subsided he</p> <p>got it that it was just a taste and but</p> <p>he recalled the age of 35 he recalled</p> <p>that that first jhana and it and then</p> <p>the thought arose in his mind he said</p> <p>the thought arose in my mind might that</p> <p>be the way to enlightenment and then</p> <p>answer came back yes so then in a</p> <p>relatively short time he reassures jhana</p> <p>and then on that basis its history</p> <p>achieved perfect enlightenment but he</p> <p>himself indicated in that statement the</p> <p>first jhana it's all it's very good to</p> <p>achieve more but that one I think</p> <p>there's pretty I think among really</p> <p>knowledgeable scholars like Kim in</p> <p>doTERRA now standing tera vaada scholar</p> <p>and very widely accepted in the Indo</p> <p>Tibetan tradition that degree this</p> <p>access to the first jhana or the full</p> <p>first jhana these are indispensable to</p> <p>really proceed along the path to become</p> <p>a sonnet on this Roddick Ayana to become</p> <p>a stream enter and so forth and on the</p> <p>my on a path to become a bodhisattva and</p> <p>proceed on the Bodhisattva path this is</p> <p>this is the kind of the the gold</p> <p>standard of what I would call mental</p> <p>health and balance and you need an</p> <p>exceptional degree because if a person</p> <p>is not just about of course stress</p> <p>reduction or gaining an insight here or</p> <p>there but Vibhishana in union with a</p> <p>passion with sha meta which is the</p> <p>Buddhist great innovation that had never</p> <p>been taught I think in the tradition of</p> <p>the Indian contemplative heritage</p> <p>prior to the Buddha was a great</p> <p>innovation it is that combination of</p> <p>schemata and the passion that has the</p> <p>power to completely eradicate mental</p> <p>afflictions from the root so that really</p> <p>caught my attention early on and I just</p> <p>felt you can't skip sha meta or you can</p> <p>but then none of your other practices</p> <p>will come to full fruition I like to</p> <p>fast forward a little bit to you meeting</p> <p>Giotto Rinpoche and coming into contact</p> <p>with those oak chain teachings again</p> <p>because you know back if there Evans</p> <p>whence this book you you it started your</p> <p>path yeah</p> <p>and I was wondering if you could speak a</p> <p>little bit with you know your earlier</p> <p>training was always Galaga in tsongkhapa</p> <p>and I was wondering how you integrated</p> <p>your earlier training in the global</p> <p>image with the Zoltan teachings if you</p> <p>could just speak a little bit to that</p> <p>sure I'll try to be concise which all my</p> <p>students learn terrible yeah I was my</p> <p>initial inspiration to follow the path</p> <p>of Tibetan Buddhism or into Tibetan</p> <p>Buddhism was this book on zouk Chen but</p> <p>then circumstances simply unfolded in</p> <p>such a way that I had really no access</p> <p>to zou Chen teachings for 20 years it</p> <p>was there and I was immensely nourished</p> <p>both in terms of growth of understanding</p> <p>and knowledge and also an</p> <p>ever-increasing sense of meaning through</p> <p>those 20 years I I wouldn't give away</p> <p>one year of it it was 20 years very well</p> <p>spent and and by the time I was 90 next</p> <p>I was 90 19 1990 don't tell how early by</p> <p>the time of 1990s always 40 years old</p> <p>I think Plato said that's when you when</p> <p>you're allowed to start start studying</p> <p>philosophy at the age of 40 I think he</p> <p>said so I had 40 years under my belt and</p> <p>one of my oldest and dearest Dharma</p> <p>friends is a woman named Sangha Kondo</p> <p>it's a very accomplished translator</p> <p>teacher really an outstanding person and</p> <p>would be with we've been buddies since</p> <p>1972 or so way back and so we kept in</p> <p>touch just in a very nice friendship and</p> <p>she early on the years and years before</p> <p>1990 she become very close disciple and</p> <p>an interpreter for gateau de mogi so I</p> <p>would drop in on her once in a while and</p> <p>I meet her Lama we would get to know him</p> <p>a little bit checking him out you know</p> <p>and then in 1990 by that time I had</p> <p>spent a couple of years in retreat out</p> <p>of academia and decided to continue my</p> <p>education so when I matriculated at</p> <p>Stanford in the in the ph.d program in</p> <p>religious studies and so I was living</p> <p>there in the Bay Area but really knowing</p> <p>that if I stayed only in academia it</p> <p>would be quite arid from my perspective</p> <p>lots of fact and not a whole lot of</p> <p>meaning in the methodology you know</p> <p>because it's just radically not Orion</p> <p>it's practice keep the objective stance</p> <p>which means stand outside up and don't</p> <p>go native whereas I was obviously I was</p> <p>already a lost cause I was native</p> <p>already and so yeah Jenna but you're</p> <p>very happily decided to move down from</p> <p>Oregon for a while to the Bay Area and</p> <p>so he gave some teachings on dream yoga</p> <p>in 1999 gioconda was translating he gave</p> <p>it in San Jose and I'd received</p> <p>teachings on dream yoga from the sole</p> <p>member jayx a great very great galloper</p> <p>Lama back in 1978 in Switzerland I</p> <p>served as his interpreter for all the</p> <p>six yoga's of Naropa so I had some</p> <p>acquaintances but Keyshia Dobson who</p> <p>organized this invited him to give us</p> <p>his teachings he totally just flat out I</p> <p>want you to receive these teachings now</p> <p>but it's over your head you know just</p> <p>get the imprints now but don't think</p> <p>about practice you're not ready yet so</p> <p>that was now 12 years later guttered</p> <p>which is teaching dream younger but he's</p> <p>teaching it like you can really practice</p> <p>this you're teaching it experientially</p> <p>and in this kind of this men mapped mode</p> <p>this mode of pith instructions there's</p> <p>nothing academic about it and I just</p> <p>drank it in like nectar and so it was</p> <p>just a very strong connection I said</p> <p>okay this this is a person I'd love to</p> <p>read you know how does one of my long</p> <p>lines and so as it turns out just a</p> <p>marvelous opportunity arose up for me</p> <p>for the next seven years from 1990</p> <p>through 97 I want to being his his</p> <p>primary interpreter he's living in the</p> <p>Bay Area Sangre Honda was up in Oregon</p> <p>so various circumstances came together</p> <p>so I had the just priceless opportunity</p> <p>to serve as his interpreter for the last</p> <p>two years I was living with him</p> <p>just a little cottage across from his</p> <p>and so he gave those teachings on you</p> <p>canto translating and then not too long</p> <p>after that he had been invited down to</p> <p>the Shambhala Center in Hollywood and he</p> <p>said Alan I'd like you to come down and</p> <p>translate for me I said sure glad to</p> <p>honored so he came down to the Shambhala</p> <p>center and he was 1990-1991 motel ago</p> <p>and he picked out two chapters from a</p> <p>great text on the Union of Muhammad</p> <p>Renzo Chen by Camacho net which hasn't</p> <p>been translated it's certainly called</p> <p>the Delta TM the great commentary and he</p> <p>picked out two chapters within the</p> <p>Mohammed results in tradition schemata</p> <p>and her passion</p> <p>and that's how he started me off so I</p> <p>was getting shamaton you know all the</p> <p>way through remember every teacher</p> <p>really and it was just breathtaking and</p> <p>seeing well here was this smooth segue</p> <p>because guess you're traveling back in</p> <p>1976 had taught us and I was</p> <p>interpreting for him pensioner punches</p> <p>text his route text and commentary on my</p> <p>mudra so and it just enchanted me I</p> <p>really drew me so during my four years</p> <p>of solitary practice I went a lot in</p> <p>that direction and now yeah Tran watch</p> <p>is teaching it from the union of the</p> <p>kagu and yingwan traditions whereas I</p> <p>had it from the Union of the guide you</p> <p>and galloper tradition so it's this</p> <p>seamless transition and so he taught</p> <p>those and it was just like I was just</p> <p>thrilled I mean literally I was thrilled</p> <p>and so he continues staying on there in</p> <p>the Bay Area and then he just taught one</p> <p>text after another and every single one</p> <p>of them a spacious path to freedom</p> <p>make it awareness natural liberation</p> <p>badness mother's teaching of the six</p> <p>bardos he taught a short text by Zhu</p> <p>Jian member jenshaw Madiba pacchiana he</p> <p>taught the Vajra essence every single</p> <p>text that he taught while during those</p> <p>seven years that I was translating for</p> <p>him every single one emphasized the</p> <p>enormous importance of Muruga of path</p> <p>we're here to not just practice Dharma</p> <p>but to reach the path and move along the</p> <p>path the fourth noble truth after all</p> <p>and every single one of them emphasized</p> <p>shammed so I had this from every side</p> <p>and so he has just been my like my</p> <p>spiritual father and my primary so chin</p> <p>Oh chin Lama and the teachings that he's</p> <p>passed on to me and authorized me to</p> <p>pass on to others is just it's a Philip</p> <p>fulfillment of my heart's desire but</p> <p>happily my root Lama of course is his</p> <p>old mentor Dalai Lama and of all the</p> <p>galoop Obama's that he is largely a</p> <p>kalapa Lama he more than any other I</p> <p>know with no comparison completely</p> <p>integrates the teachings ons auction</p> <p>which you receive from Tengu cancer</p> <p>temperature and other great Enuma Lamas</p> <p>and his whole his whole formidable good</p> <p>look the background and I received on</p> <p>multiple occasions ochen teachings from</p> <p>him and so he made it very easy for me</p> <p>here's you know the Lama of Lamas as far</p> <p>as I'm concerned and seamlessly</p> <p>integrating these and that's what I've</p> <p>that's what I've sought to do for the</p> <p>last 26 years so it's been in no way an</p> <p>abandonment of my back</p> <p>tera vaada Ella for six months in sri</p> <p>lanka studied with inanimate raya</p> <p>formidable Sri Lankan teacher monk</p> <p>scholar he took me under his wing and</p> <p>trained me so it's in no way a</p> <p>disengagement for my tera vaada</p> <p>background legal oopah but rather it's</p> <p>the one translation of Zhou Chen is the</p> <p>great incumbent the great completion the</p> <p>great perfection are particularly good</p> <p>but there's ocean makes sense of all of</p> <p>the different paths and from my mind not</p> <p>only within Buddhism but actually it</p> <p>enables me to make sense of spiritual</p> <p>traditions outside of Buddhism and for</p> <p>that matter corner cosmology and certain</p> <p>elements of love science and philosophy</p> <p>of mind thank you so much my pleasure so</p> <p>I think we're gonna have about a five</p> <p>minute break and then Alan is going to</p> <p>come back and give us a short Dharma</p> <p>talk thank you well I'd like to go</p> <p>during these 20 minutes is to a very</p> <p>rich and concise excerpt from the Vajra</p> <p>essence which is a third of the three</p> <p>volumes here of Dijon lingas collected</p> <p>works arms of chen in which Padma Sam</p> <p>bhava by way of do gem Linga draws to my</p> <p>mind a marvelously clear distinction</p> <p>between what we call mind or chitta</p> <p>in Sanskrit and rickman were pristine</p> <p>awareness what's the difference between</p> <p>the two and I think he lays this out in</p> <p>a definitive extremely clear fashion but</p> <p>I'd like to build up to a little bit</p> <p>leave that for the grand finale and go</p> <p>back to excerpts from the text that for</p> <p>those of you who have followed the</p> <p>course on the foolish Dharma of an idiot</p> <p>clothed in madmen feathers one of the</p> <p>most concise of Digium lingas</p> <p>masterpieces really unsoaked chen just</p> <p>take a brief excerpt from that because</p> <p>he's talking about how you set out on</p> <p>the path of so chen</p> <p>what's the entry and i quote from a pure</p> <p>vision a visionary teaching that he</p> <p>received in which he's told in in a</p> <p>dream hey hey hue blind one who wished</p> <p>to enter the authentic path listen</p> <p>by authentic path that means a path that</p> <p>actually brings about irreversible</p> <p>purification transformation so you never</p> <p>fall back if it's not that it's not a</p> <p>path it's practicing Dharma it's being</p> <p>virtuous perhaps but a path means you're</p> <p>actually evolving irreversibly on the</p> <p>path of ever growing freedom and</p> <p>awakening and so those who wish to enter</p> <p>the authentic path listen the body is</p> <p>like a paper bag blown by the wind</p> <p>speech is like the sound of air passing</p> <p>through a pipe this mind is a creator of</p> <p>both samsara and Nirvana among these</p> <p>three identify which is primary you have</p> <p>a long time to wait before you'll see or</p> <p>hear something called meditation and so</p> <p>he's starting out with this emphasis</p> <p>this encouragement for us individually</p> <p>to investigate not just think about or</p> <p>rely upon other people Authority and so</p> <p>forth or simple logic but investigate</p> <p>experientially within our own continuum</p> <p>of being embodied human beings with</p> <p>minds and bodies and speech among these</p> <p>three ways of manifesting in the world</p> <p>body speech and mind often called the</p> <p>three doors which is primary and he</p> <p>really emphasizes in more than one I</p> <p>think perhaps all of his five major</p> <p>treatises on so Chen this is the first</p> <p>thing you've got to get right because if</p> <p>you're wobbly amorphous or you just</p> <p>flat-out wrong you'll not be able to</p> <p>enter this path because you're starting</p> <p>out with a fundamental fault hypothesis</p> <p>and everything will go screwy from that</p> <p>perspective and so of course in the Seok</p> <p>Jin view it is the mind that is primary</p> <p>speech is derivative and even body is</p> <p>derivative now this is an absolutely</p> <p>core theme it's not simply a required</p> <p>belief it's a truth that must be known</p> <p>where you decide on in this path if you</p> <p>sing something contrary that's fine you</p> <p>don't get punished for it but</p> <p>this path is not open to you and so this</p> <p>has though precedence all the way down</p> <p>to the most foundational teachings in</p> <p>the whole Buddhist tradition in the Pali</p> <p>Canon for example in the Samia ticket</p> <p>nakiya the Buddha states and I quote the</p> <p>world is led by the mind just generally</p> <p>in the universe mind is primary ok or</p> <p>the ever so often quoted first verse of</p> <p>the first chapter of the Dhammapada all</p> <p>phenomena are preceded by the mind issue</p> <p>forth from the mind and consist of the</p> <p>mind clearly that has multiple</p> <p>interpretations I don't mean to be</p> <p>always simplistic here but he said what</p> <p>he said and then we go to the Mahayana</p> <p>tradition to the one of the minor sutras</p> <p>that rathne mega sutra and here the</p> <p>buddha in the sutra states all phenomena</p> <p>are preceded by the mind when the mind</p> <p>is comprehended all phenomena are</p> <p>comprehended by bringing the mind under</p> <p>control all things are brought under</p> <p>control so this is a recurrent theme</p> <p>through all schools of Buddhism that the</p> <p>mind is primary when we address the</p> <p>first noble truth yes there's physical</p> <p>pain never to be marginalised but after</p> <p>all the deeper forms of suffering are</p> <p>not physical they're mental the</p> <p>suffering of change the suffering that</p> <p>goes with just the grasping to I am its</p> <p>mental suffering when you look at the</p> <p>second noble truth it's mental it's not</p> <p>brain it's not genetics if not</p> <p>environment it's not politics it's the</p> <p>mind it's your mental afflictions that</p> <p>are at the root of all suffering when</p> <p>you go to the third noble truth it's the</p> <p>mind that he/she is Nirvana not your</p> <p>body and you look at the fourth noble</p> <p>truth and it's all training of the mind</p> <p>certainly ethics has to do with body and</p> <p>speech but above all is the training of</p> <p>the mind so the entire framework of the</p> <p>Buddha Dharma is primarily emphasizing</p> <p>mind as primary and this is indicated in</p> <p>the Buddha's own night of his</p> <p>enlightenment when his first insight</p> <p>which he said I saw with direct</p> <p>perception was seeing countless of his</p> <p>own past lives he said I saw it with</p> <p>direct perception second watch of the</p> <p>night I watched countless past lives of</p> <p>other sentient beings and then he saw</p> <p>the interrelationship what we called the</p> <p>laws of karma the interrelationship that</p> <p>is not just scattered or stochastic</p> <p>random going from here to there</p> <p>but there's causality from former to</p> <p>later and so this is a starting insight</p> <p>it is necessary we're proceeding further</p> <p>on his auction path but it's also</p> <p>crucial they're enlightened eater in the</p> <p>Pali Canon the tera vaada all of my an</p> <p>olive Adrianna is there in Chan and in</p> <p>Zen and then we have the world view that</p> <p>we're very familiar with especially in a</p> <p>very educated city like Boston and</p> <p>Cambridge where if I can paraphrase a</p> <p>very common view nowadays all phenomena</p> <p>as in all experiences are preceded by</p> <p>the brain issue forth from the brain and</p> <p>consists of the brain but between the</p> <p>mind and the brain the brain is primary</p> <p>and in the immortal words of John John</p> <p>Searle and many others the mind is what</p> <p>the brain does and if you're having any</p> <p>kind of mental problem well it's</p> <p>basically a brain problem and so they</p> <p>turned it entirely on the head on his</p> <p>head and could not be more diametrically</p> <p>opposed so somebody is flamboyantly</p> <p>wrong and if we are objective and</p> <p>open-minded about this the Buddha</p> <p>himself was having basically a</p> <p>hallucinations on the might of at night</p> <p>of his enlightenment and Buddhism has</p> <p>basically been fundamentally psychotic</p> <p>ever since that's a logical possibility</p> <p>it is a logical possibility that they</p> <p>just you know it's pre-scientific is</p> <p>superstitious it's hocus pocus mumbo</p> <p>jumbo and claptrap I've heard all of</p> <p>these attributed to the Buddhist</p> <p>teachings that's a possibility or the</p> <p>other possibility is that for the last</p> <p>hundred and fifty years science has been</p> <p>profoundly led astray by the dogma of</p> <p>scientific materialism there's is it's</p> <p>it's a prelude to the juicy bit so you</p> <p>have to bear with me if you will you can</p> <p>back out in a minute there's a fella</p> <p>named Daniel Simpson I'm looking forward</p> <p>to meeting we've course founded back and</p> <p>forth he wrote a very provocative</p> <p>article called Buddhist meditation and</p> <p>cognitive sciences daniel simpson</p> <p>buddhist meditation cognitive sciences</p> <p>and find it online is worth reading he</p> <p>did a lot of good research and I quote</p> <p>him here he says one minor life</p> <p>scientist Richard Davidson was a very</p> <p>dear friend of mine a wonderful human</p> <p>being very bright scientist and just a</p> <p>very fine human being all together very</p> <p>good heart I've known him enough for 20</p> <p>more than 20 years</p> <p>one minor life scientists bridge</p> <p>Davidson has bent over backwards to</p> <p>avoid causing a fence while defending</p> <p>materialism he acknowledges being asked</p> <p>quote sharply but respectfully by the</p> <p>Dalai Lama to quote distinguished</p> <p>between that which has been empirically</p> <p>confirmed and that which is simply</p> <p>assumed and has become part of our</p> <p>conceptual theoretical and conceptual</p> <p>dogma</p> <p>so as Holland is kind of call them on</p> <p>the carpet so what do you guys really</p> <p>know which is backed by empirical</p> <p>evidence and what are you simply simply</p> <p>accepting out of pure site tradition</p> <p>theoretical and conceptual dogma so as</p> <p>holiness can be tough in a very</p> <p>benevolent respectful way but tough and</p> <p>so rigid he evidently commanded this and</p> <p>yet as as Daniel Simpson says yet he'd</p> <p>Richard Davidson feels obliged to note</p> <p>that quote certain scientific</p> <p>assumptions are themselves based on</p> <p>well-established principles adding says</p> <p>daniel simpson via the circum</p> <p>circumlocution some would say so Richard</p> <p>Davidson distanced herself a little bit</p> <p>from what he's about to say not much</p> <p>that the dependence of them of mind on</p> <p>brain is one such assumption that has</p> <p>been subjected to countless empirical</p> <p>tests and each and every one of them has</p> <p>provided support for this general claim</p> <p>so that would imply that some point in</p> <p>the past there was some really</p> <p>compelling physical evidence empirical</p> <p>evidence that showed that the mind and</p> <p>this refers to the whole bandwidth of</p> <p>states of consciousness that all of them</p> <p>are dependent on on the brain or to</p> <p>quote John Searle again the mind is what</p> <p>brain does the brain is primary in the</p> <p>mind is just what the brain does is a</p> <p>function that equality and epiphenomena</p> <p>of the brain so one would think well</p> <p>they do have some really strong</p> <p>empirical evidence for that</p> <p>unfortunately that's not true at all and</p> <p>so as much as I love Ritchie and</p> <p>respected in so many different ways this</p> <p>is a flamboyantly misleading statement</p> <p>that is ever since about 1963 when the</p> <p>term neuroscience was coined by a man</p> <p>named Schmidt Schmidt</p> <p>a biologist at MIT she coined the term</p> <p>and he and some of his contemporaries</p> <p>back in the early 60s</p> <p>they started the discipline they coined</p> <p>the term neuroscience and they started</p> <p>the discipline of neuroscience at MIT</p> <p>and the first college that actually had</p> <p>an undergraduate major in neuroscience</p> <p>was my alma mater Amherst College 1973</p> <p>but what was remarkable about the</p> <p>origins of modern neuroscience is this</p> <p>man Schmidt was trained as a biologist</p> <p>he had no training in philosophy of mind</p> <p>or psychology had no training in the</p> <p>mind at all he was trained only in</p> <p>chemistry biology physics and they</p> <p>simply he and his contemporaries fifty</p> <p>years ago simply decided that they would</p> <p>stop start using the term mind and brain</p> <p>interchangeably and act as if the</p> <p>mind-body problem had been solved they</p> <p>haven't even actually made any headway</p> <p>there was actually no evidence</p> <p>whatsoever that the mind is nothing more</p> <p>than a function of the brain they just</p> <p>started talking that way</p> <p>they just started talking as if the</p> <p>mind-body problem had been solved how</p> <p>the mind interacts with the brain and</p> <p>vice versa it had been somehow solved</p> <p>whereas it was more like church council</p> <p>just kinda citing a point of theology</p> <p>rather than a conclusion drawn on</p> <p>empirical evidence and what happened has</p> <p>happened over the last 50 years is a</p> <p>Society for Neuroscience which is the</p> <p>you know the Church Council of</p> <p>neuroscience they've simply decided that</p> <p>all of our scientific study of the brain</p> <p>will work with the assumption that the</p> <p>mind is the brain of the mind as a</p> <p>function of the brain and any other</p> <p>theory and any evidence that stands</p> <p>outside of that or challenges that we</p> <p>will ignore or ridicule and that's</p> <p>what's happened for the last 50 years we</p> <p>will ignore or ridicule any theory of</p> <p>the mind and the brain that is not</p> <p>materialistic I love science and I am</p> <p>deeply saddened by this travesty of</p> <p>science because Ricci implies here that</p> <p>the theory the hypothesis that the mind</p> <p>is simply the function of the brain has</p> <p>been tested time and time again and has</p> <p>always come out positive but that's not</p> <p>even remotely true I've looked for 25</p> <p>years at scientific study science</p> <p>scientific theory</p> <p>of the mind and reductionistic ones</p> <p>materialistic ones and interestingly</p> <p>they they differ a lot but they all have</p> <p>something in common not one of them is</p> <p>scientifically testable or has ever been</p> <p>tested scientifically they simply assume</p> <p>it's a matter of belief so this is</p> <p>really quite a travesty I would call it</p> <p>a scam a hoax</p> <p>I would call it brain washing because I</p> <p>think it's most literally correct is</p> <p>that that which is a very real problem</p> <p>and which Donald Donald Hoffman a very</p> <p>good neuroscientist at University of</p> <p>california-irvine he commented very</p> <p>cogently that ever since the late 19th</p> <p>century at a time of Thomas Huxley the</p> <p>founder of the Church of scientific</p> <p>materialism there's actually been no</p> <p>progress at all on solving the mind-body</p> <p>problem we know that the two are</p> <p>correlated but how are they correlated</p> <p>how does the placebo effect work how do</p> <p>chemicals electricity in the brain</p> <p>generate or even influence the mind how</p> <p>do our thoughts our emotions our desires</p> <p>and aspirations how do they influence</p> <p>the brain we are as ignorant now as we</p> <p>were 150 years ago and this is what</p> <p>happens when you pretend to have</p> <p>knowledge where all you have is belief</p> <p>is called an illusion of knowledge and</p> <p>historically has been the greatest</p> <p>impediment to scientific discovery</p> <p>imagine that you know something that</p> <p>would in fact you only believe and that</p> <p>is the standard view in modern</p> <p>psychology neuroscience and philosophy</p> <p>of mind 90% of them are all materialists</p> <p>and they simply assume that if you don't</p> <p>believe that you're either ignorant or</p> <p>stupid so this is a great challenge this</p> <p>is great empirical challenge it's not a</p> <p>battle of science and religion or</p> <p>Buddhism versus science it's actually</p> <p>rather on the contrary a challenge</p> <p>between empiricism and closed-minded</p> <p>dogmatism and Buddhist can be as</p> <p>dogmatic and closed-minded as anybody</p> <p>else but I'm sorry to say I found</p> <p>scientists can be as dogmatic and</p> <p>closed-minded as any religious</p> <p>fundamentalist I've ever met and so our</p> <p>salvation here if I may speak in an</p> <p>evangelical way is a return to</p> <p>experience a return to empiricism but</p> <p>not exclude first-person experience</p> <p>because about a hundred years ago with a</p> <p>rise behavioral psychology there was a</p> <p>decision</p> <p>again not a discovery but as this is</p> <p>decision we will no longer we behavioral</p> <p>psychologists will no longer refer to</p> <p>subjective experience of any kind will</p> <p>never speak of consciousness and we will</p> <p>not ever use introspection so imagine at</p> <p>the time of Galileo if the church had</p> <p>gotten really heavy-handed and said we</p> <p>can talk about the views of the sale of</p> <p>you know the stars and planets but never</p> <p>look through a telescope that's they did</p> <p>not succeed but the materialists have</p> <p>succeeded in banishing introspection</p> <p>from academic psychology let alone</p> <p>cognitive neuroscience for the last</p> <p>hundred years it's been quite a shame</p> <p>and so to the rescue as science I</p> <p>believe I'm speaking with some passion</p> <p>here but joyfulness as well Buddhism</p> <p>also falls into dogmatism in tradition</p> <p>into close-minded sectarianism it does</p> <p>people do that whether they're Marxists</p> <p>or the Republicans and so forth and so</p> <p>on</p> <p>we do that science can help rescue</p> <p>Buddhism from falling into close-minded</p> <p>traditionalism and ritualism and</p> <p>complacency it can help us return to</p> <p>empiricism we've got a great tradition</p> <p>of empiricism going back to the Buddha</p> <p>and the Buddhist can rescue the mind</p> <p>sciences further from the complacency of</p> <p>thinking they've already solved the my</p> <p>problem my body problem even to the</p> <p>point of absurdity like some</p> <p>neuroscientist saying consciousness</p> <p>doesn't exist there's no mind-body</p> <p>problem because there's no mind or one</p> <p>renowned philosophers mine saying</p> <p>appearances don't exist if you take that</p> <p>take those statements versus the</p> <p>statement that the universe is ten</p> <p>thousand years old and human beings</p> <p>existed out on the sixth day pretty much</p> <p>like us now which is more absurd</p> <p>forty-two percent of Americans believe</p> <p>that creationism eighteen percent</p> <p>believe that the Sun goes around the</p> <p>earth but what's more absurd those views</p> <p>are the views that introspection is</p> <p>impossible that subjective experiences</p> <p>don't exist because they're not physical</p> <p>consciousness that self doesn't exist</p> <p>and appearances don't exist I think the</p> <p>sight of materialism has pushed the</p> <p>furthest limits of absurdity so we come</p> <p>back to sanity that the mind does exist</p> <p>is enormous ly efficacious and in fact</p> <p>upon very careful and</p> <p>you may very well draw the conclusion</p> <p>that it is primary but now the</p> <p>ontological burden so to speak what is</p> <p>primary in the universe in the Buddhist</p> <p>view from the Pali Canon right through</p> <p>its open the mind is of paramount</p> <p>importance the course mind what we</p> <p>divide enta Phi is the psyche clearly</p> <p>that's dependent upon the body but</p> <p>that's not been doubted for millennia</p> <p>when the Buddha himself practice ascetic</p> <p>practices for six years he let his</p> <p>health really really get damaged he was</p> <p>weak emaciated and he saw that his mind</p> <p>had become weak and he recognized he had</p> <p>to restore his physical strength and</p> <p>health for his mind to bounce back and</p> <p>be strong and resilient so this it</p> <p>didn't no mystery since the time of the</p> <p>Buddha but that's the most superficial</p> <p>level of mind zouk chen the whole</p> <p>buddhist tradition is at large and the</p> <p>so Qin tradition in particular invites</p> <p>us go beneath the surface investigate</p> <p>the nature of mind the primacy of mind</p> <p>and some physicists are coming to the</p> <p>same conclusion after all what we do</p> <p>what do we know most immediately is</p> <p>information appearances in information</p> <p>and appearances are not physical and the</p> <p>very categories of mind of mind matter</p> <p>space time energy they're all conceptual</p> <p>constructs based on information</p> <p>informations not physical so which</p> <p>brings us back to zouk Chen there's the</p> <p>first point it's not Dogma it's not a</p> <p>catechism it's not you have to believe</p> <p>this but you must investigate until you</p> <p>come to some uncertainty is the mind</p> <p>primary or not and if it is alright</p> <p>that's something big but then a</p> <p>brilliant stroke and we see this running</p> <p>through all of duty on linguistic</p> <p>teachings oh my goodness that twenty</p> <p>minutes go by</p> <p>is that possible no that was supposed to</p> <p>be the prelude can I go a little bit</p> <p>longer okay at least have to give this</p> <p>that was really fast amazing but I</p> <p>warned I warned Daniel I do that but now</p> <p>that you see mine is primary then the</p> <p>next in the strategy this path in zou</p> <p>Chen is not universally true in all</p> <p>schools of Buddhism now investigate the</p> <p>nature of the mind that which apprehends</p> <p>that which knows that which observes</p> <p>observe the nature of the agent the mind</p> <p>that meditates that gets upset that</p> <p>becomes compassionate engages in virtue</p> <p>nonvirtue investigate this all creating</p> <p>sovereign the mind and what does he say</p> <p>here back to mutton feathers again in a</p> <p>visionary experience a being and</p> <p>appearing in one of his dreams since son</p> <p>of the claw of the clear light Vadra</p> <p>essence addressing digital mingi says</p> <p>your own mind is the basis of all</p> <p>samsara and Nirvana the origin from</p> <p>which it first emerges is empty the</p> <p>location in which it resides in the</p> <p>interim after it's arisen before passes</p> <p>is empty the destination to which it</p> <p>finally goes is empty perceive the</p> <p>essential nature of emptiness it this</p> <p>mind it has no form shape color or</p> <p>source it is neither one nor many and it</p> <p>is neither emanated nor reabsorbed it</p> <p>transcends the parameters of existence</p> <p>and non-existence it is empty of the</p> <p>conventional words of negation and</p> <p>affirmation it is spontaneously</p> <p>actualized as great emptiness since I</p> <p>said I would be punctual I'm gonna wrap</p> <p>up that rather long juicy quote is that</p> <p>no way I could finished in just a few</p> <p>minutes here's a strategy I was asked by</p> <p>one friend of mine to give a bit of</p> <p>pointing out instructions all right</p> <p>let's give it give it you take a crack</p> <p>at wean strategy here it's all very well</p> <p>to speak profound words and be citing</p> <p>great masters and so forth but when we</p> <p>return home if we're inspired by this</p> <p>path of the great protection how can we</p> <p>get up on our lovely little</p> <p>legs and start walking on the path I'll</p> <p>sit make a suggestion okay but I would</p> <p>suggest for those of us living in cities</p> <p>like Boston I live in the outskirts of</p> <p>Los Angeles I visit cities all over the</p> <p>world we all know it in this modern era</p> <p>with this way of life with this amount</p> <p>of information this amount of</p> <p>stimulation we have the amount of</p> <p>workload we have the demands on our</p> <p>attention that we have we are running an</p> <p>experiment on ourselves and I think is</p> <p>quite a cruel experiment to see how far</p> <p>we can be pushed without all of us going</p> <p>insane the first thing as we had in the</p> <p>preliminary exercise to learn in a</p> <p>non-trivial way how to set your body</p> <p>speech mind at ease no wonder MBSR</p> <p>mindfulness based stress reduction is so</p> <p>popular and so helpful because people</p> <p>are desperate to get some relief from</p> <p>strain and stress that's just wearing</p> <p>them out and sapping all the joy from</p> <p>their lives so to learn through</p> <p>discipline how to set the body and mind</p> <p>at ease mindfulness breathing is</p> <p>marvelous with it settle settle body</p> <p>speech and mind at ease and then</p> <p>mindfulness breathing full body</p> <p>awareness let your awareness permeate</p> <p>the whole field of the body but in the</p> <p>midst of that that's already take a</p> <p>little step towards zouk jam the great</p> <p>perfection and that is while attending</p> <p>to the sensations corresponding to or</p> <p>correlated with the respiration</p> <p>throughout the entire body kind of the</p> <p>flow of energy through the body</p> <p>corresponding to or related to the</p> <p>respiration while attending to the</p> <p>movements within the body corresponding</p> <p>to the respiration attend to this from a</p> <p>place of stillness your awareness your</p> <p>mental awareness resting in stillness</p> <p>while simultaneously attending to the</p> <p>flux the ebb and flow of the sensations</p> <p>of the breath throughout the body</p> <p>stillness and movement stillness and</p> <p>movement simultaneously as you calm as</p> <p>the mind stabilizes as the clarity of</p> <p>the mind like the Sun rising over the</p> <p>horizon the clarity that might becomes</p> <p>clearer and clearer but make a segue</p> <p>into a practice it's called by various</p> <p>names one is simply observing the mind</p> <p>again from a vantage point of stillness</p> <p>direct your attention now single point</p> <ul> <li>one out of six domains of experience</li> </ul> <p>the domain of mental events of thoughts</p> <p>of memories mental images the same</p> <p>domain in which dreams arise at night</p> <p>but also subjective impulses like</p> <p>desires and emotions and from the</p> <p>vantage of stillness of clarity of</p> <p>stillness awareness that is at ease</p> <p>still and clear observe the theater of</p> <p>the mind the comings and goings of</p> <p>thoughts emotions memories fantasies and</p> <p>so forth coming and going arising in the</p> <p>space of the mind resolving back into</p> <p>that space and observe it in an ongoing</p> <p>way from that vantage point of stillness</p> <p>without wit called psychologist called</p> <p>cognitive fusion without getting caught</p> <p>up and carried away by the memories the</p> <p>desires the emotions and so on and then</p> <p>as you go deeper look to the intervals</p> <p>between thoughts attend to the very</p> <p>space that the mind itself and it then</p> <p>clearly discerning ly observe what is</p> <p>the nature of this space is it physical</p> <p>space this is the face of the mind does</p> <p>it have color does it have shape does</p> <p>that have a center of periphery is that</p> <p>have form does it have any physical</p> <p>qualities whatsoever observe it closely</p> <p>the very space of the mind and then as</p> <p>we move in that in this strategy this is</p> <p>now a very condensed course as you're</p> <p>able to maintain that flow of clear</p> <p>discerning awareness of the space of the</p> <p>mind and observing also how thoughts</p> <p>emerge from that space not emerging from</p> <p>neurons which is a crazy idea</p> <p>the notion of dreams and motion coming</p> <p>from chemicals electricity one of the</p> <p>craziest ideas I've ever heard but it's</p> <p>groupthink one person says that a bunch</p> <p>of people say it ok dispense with that</p> <p>nonsense you can see thoughts arising</p> <p>from the space of the mind and</p> <p>dissolving back into the space of the</p> <p>mind and the thoughts are non-physical</p> <p>than the space that the mind is</p> <p>non-physical</p> <p>get over it you know and let this be</p> <p>incorporated into the scientific study</p> <p>of the mind we've been ignoring</p> <p>first-person perspective for a hundred</p> <p>and fifty years it's time to stop as</p> <p>they say in Italy basta enough already</p> <p>let's be scientific in the study of the</p> <p>mind by observing it carefully like all</p> <p>other branches of science observe</p> <p>carefully the phenomena they're trying</p> <p>to seek to understand don't you study</p> <p>brain and behavior</p> <p>so observe this based of the might and</p> <p>now do something very clever with draw</p> <p>the vector of your attention and</p> <p>withdraw right into the very nature of</p> <p>being aware itself have no</p> <p>directionality no vector no object of</p> <p>attention outside of awareness itself</p> <p>and simply rest in an ongoing flow of</p> <p>awareness of being aware consciousness</p> <p>of consciousness itself it makes common</p> <p>sense that if you want to understand</p> <p>something look at it closely for a</p> <p>sustained period</p> <p>that's how Galileo discovered the moons</p> <p>of Jupiter and sunspots and the phases</p> <p>of Venus and craters on the moon he</p> <p>observed carefully and in the sustained</p> <p>fashion and started the scientific</p> <p>revolution it's high time for the first</p> <p>revolution and the mine Sciences to</p> <p>begin but that means we have to do what</p> <p>Galileo did what Galileo did what Darwin</p> <p>did and what William James did look</p> <p>carefully at the phenomena you're</p> <p>seeking to understand observe</p> <p>consciousness naked ly without mediation</p> <p>we're almost there that's called</p> <p>schemata it's a sus lesson most profound</p> <p>method of schemata there isn't a whole</p> <p>Buddhist tradition the awareness of</p> <p>being conscious itself and now one step</p> <p>further and we'll slip into the domain</p> <p>absorption now carefully incisively</p> <p>observe that which is observing we call</p> <p>it the mind observe the mind we call it</p> <p>awareness</p> <p>observe awareness observe that which is</p> <p>aware that which thinks that which</p> <p>intends observe the observer and cut</p> <p>through the mind right down to the very</p> <p>ground which is Ripa and xoJane</p> <p>meditation is nothing more or less than</p> <p>cutting through to pristine awareness</p> <p>rickwaa and viewing reality from that</p> <p>perspective and that right there is the</p> <p>view of the great production so in your</p> <p>practice I just gave you enough to keep</p> <p>you busy for at least few days</p> <p>in your practice when you come to the</p> <p>end there when you're coming to the</p> <p>where you're able to sustain a flow of</p> <p>awareness of awareness and then you cut</p> <p>through the flow of awareness of</p> <p>awareness to the penetration to that</p> <p>which is aware you know the distinction</p> <p>between the awareness that gets</p> <p>distracted and gets dull and get</p> <p>centered and gets distracted again and</p> <p>that's the mind but as you cut through</p> <p>to that which is aware you may cut</p> <p>through to a dimension of awareness that</p> <p>is unborn and unceasing that never moves</p> <p>because it's not in time it's unchanging</p> <p>and you can never wrap your conceptual</p> <p>mind around it because this baseline</p> <p>this ground of awareness from which all</p> <p>conditioned states of consciousness</p> <p>emerge transcends a very parameters of</p> <p>existence and non-existence it</p> <p>transcends all conceptual categories it</p> <p>can be known is not an ultimate mystery</p> <p>it can be known directly without</p> <p>mediation but only by itself it can know</p> <p>itself but your conceptual mind cannot</p> <p>grasp it it's beyond its paygrade it's</p> <p>beyond its scope so this rig by this</p> <p>pristine awareness it is present right</p> <p>now it is where your awareness it is it</p> <p>is where your thoughts are it is not</p> <p>something separate it's not somebody</p> <p>else's it's not gods or Buddha's or some</p> <p>other persons it's the ground state of</p> <p>your own awareness and not and then this</p> <p>node hidden in plain sight so try that</p> <p>see what happened thank you so much</p> <p>so the best question is what is the</p> <p>difference between the shaman to</p> <p>practice of awareness of awareness and</p> <p>the practice of trencher very good I</p> <p>could draw for my own background here</p> <p>but I'd rather draw from the explicit</p> <p>answer to that question from from and so</p> <p>this question was posed to him last fall</p> <p>and his answer in fact I think I was one</p> <p>maybe I was one that I think I might</p> <p>have been I wanted to get just</p> <p>razor-sharp clarity and I did and so</p> <p>here's the answer and that is anyone can</p> <p>practice awareness of awareness you can</p> <p>be a materialist a Christian an agnostic</p> <p>Muslim Buddhist anything you like it has</p> <p>no theory had no viewer that goes with</p> <p>it</p> <p>it's technology some of this technology</p> <p>is contempt into technology the passion</p> <p>is contemplative science and to become</p> <p>the vidyadhara or practice that</p> <p>meditation is very deep science and so</p> <p>to practice awareness of awareness is</p> <p>simply resting in the flow this</p> <p>phenomenological or expansion flow of</p> <p>being aware that's all there is to it</p> <p>but now you may use the same method and</p> <p>that is just be resting in the flow of</p> <p>awareness</p> <p>perhaps observing that which is aware</p> <p>but if you cut through the conditioned</p> <p>mind this mind that is arising from</p> <p>moment a moment that is conditioned by</p> <p>many many causes and additions that</p> <p>becomes virtuous and non-virtuous dull</p> <p>and clear and so forth if you cut</p> <p>through this fluctuating and conditioned</p> <p>mind you cut through that it's texture</p> <p>it means cutting through something rigid</p> <p>and gnarly and cut through to the ground</p> <p>then and you're actually are viewing</p> <p>reality from the perspective of Ripa</p> <p>that's your vantage point the method is</p> <p>the same but because you're viewing</p> <p>reality from the perspective of rikta</p> <p>the method is now textured so the same</p> <p>method without the view is schemata with</p> <p>the view is textured</p> <p>so far over ordinary experience we know</p> <p>that physical brief affects our mind</p> <p>let's say the body's tired and drink</p> <p>your coffee we know it affects the</p> <p>clarity and so on so we see that cause</p> <p>and effect of correlation so are you</p> <p>saying that Britten effects let's say</p> <p>mind or ordinary parts a battle alone</p> <p>Kristina marinus that is independent of</p> <p>the brain there's a very clear</p> <p>demarcation within the suction tradition</p> <p>but I've seen it elsewhere as well of</p> <p>three dimensions of mind and what</p> <p>psychologists study is what the</p> <p>Buddhists call and the skull including</p> <p>Freud and Freud for sure and modern</p> <p>cogman psychology affective psychology</p> <p>and cognitive science when they refer to</p> <p>mind it's what Buddhists call course</p> <p>mind course mind and this is the mind</p> <p>and not only mental awareness but also</p> <p>visual perception auditory and so forth</p> <p>so course mind includes the five</p> <p>physical senses and mental the mind as</p> <p>in this this phenomenon this faculty</p> <p>that by which we remember think imagine</p> <p>hope fear and so forth and this arises</p> <p>in dependence upon the brain right and</p> <p>this been known but it's this is not</p> <p>breaking news this has been known for a</p> <p>very long time damage the brain and you</p> <p>afferent Fred mine had his optic nerve</p> <p>damage</p> <p>now he's blind in one eye okay visual</p> <p>cortex is fine but one little part the</p> <p>optic nerve is damaged now he's blind in</p> <p>one eye and likewise with Alzheimer's</p> <p>with Lou Gehrig's disease with brain</p> <p>trauma with schizophrenia with genetic</p> <p>with with mental imbalances that may</p> <p>have a genetic influence all of these</p> <p>are influencing the brain but also</p> <p>through mental training de viously</p> <p>exercising the mind so neurogenesis</p> <p>kicks in we know this a very strong</p> <p>correlations and here neuroscience is</p> <p>providing a very great service in in</p> <p>highlighting many of these strong</p> <p>correlations we also know as a thought</p> <p>experiment</p> <p>I'll do it on myself so I won't seem</p> <p>mean to others if I take a mallet with a</p> <p>hammer and I just start hitting my head</p> <p>with it very hard</p> <p>I'll start losing one faculty after</p> <p>another after another until I'm dead and</p> <p>that would look like but you damage the</p> <p>mine a little bit and then more and more</p> <p>and now you really sledgehammer it and</p> <p>I'm no longer breathing and now the</p> <p>brain is now finished if you're studying</p> <p>the brain of studying the mind only from</p> <p>physical perspective the very reasonable</p> <p>conclusion would be look damaged be in a</p> <p>little bit and you go blind or you can't</p> <p>remember remember as well or if you have</p> <p>emotional bipolarity or what have you</p> <p>damaged it more you're more mentally</p> <p>impaired and damaged that a whole lot</p> <p>you don't have a mind anymore</p> <p>this is a very natural reasonable</p> <p>conclusion if you're looking at the mind</p> <p>from only the outside but in a way it's</p> <p>not breaking news we've known this for a</p> <p>very long time and so in that dimension</p> <p>of the mind why the Buddha needed to get</p> <p>some a good meal and restore his health</p> <p>to be true enlightenment this was a</p> <p>message from the very beginning as a</p> <p>Buddhism but with there's something in</p> <p>between this mind which psychologists</p> <p>have studied indirectly by way of brain</p> <p>behavior and questionnaires and the</p> <p>Buddhist content ative Hindu Christian</p> <p>Sufi and so forth have examined very</p> <p>rigorously from a first-person</p> <p>perspective there's something between</p> <p>this mind was definitely my mind I'm 67</p> <p>my mind did not exist 68 years ago Alan</p> <p>Wallace at mind nowhere in the universe</p> <p>and 68 years from now I think is a very</p> <p>safe bet Alan's mind will not exist</p> <p>anywhere in the universe because this</p> <p>person's mind is arising upon</p> <p>independence upon this person brain</p> <p>damage it and there are consequences but</p> <p>is that all there is to it</p> <p>I call if one concludes well what we</p> <p>study it is all there is I call that a</p> <p>flat mind a perspective like Flat Earth</p> <p>there's a flat mind because by and large</p> <p>academic psychology neuroscientists are</p> <p>studying only normal people and mentally</p> <p>impaired in brain damage brain damaged</p> <p>people and when they do study meditators</p> <p>they studied their brains and behavior</p> <p>you know this like trying to understand</p> <p>meditation by step understanding</p> <p>mathematics by studying studying math</p> <p>math mathematician brains it's not</p> <p>really a very skillful approach and so</p> <p>when you shut down the mind that is you</p> <p>deactivate the mind what we call it</p> <p>falling asleep and the course mind is</p> <p>inactive in non lucid stage for non REM</p> <p>sleep deep asleep you don't explicitly</p> <p>know anything at all</p> <p>you're not even that you're asleep so</p> <p>many many psychologists think then</p> <p>you're totally unconscious I beg to</p> <p>differ</p> <p>you have no explicit consciousness but</p> <p>there's an implicit flow of</p> <p>consciousness and we call that the</p> <p>substrate consciousness or the alive it</p> <p>Nana from the so Chen perspective but of</p> <p>course we don't get normally get to</p> <p>enjoy it because we're not explicitly</p> <p>aware of it</p> <p>but it is possible to be lucid in</p> <p>dreamless sleep you can be in deep</p> <p>dreamless sleep and know it that is</p> <p>definitely possible</p> <p>just like lucid dreaming is possible</p> <p>this is possible we enter into this</p> <p>state and substrate consciousness when</p> <p>we fall deep asleep this is AB evanka</p> <p>and the tera vaada tradition when you go</p> <p>comatose you faint you achieve schemata</p> <p>and you die but among those various</p> <p>options about four of them would just</p> <p>happen naturally schemata you access</p> <p>that same dimension of consciousness but</p> <p>you do so with increasing clarity as</p> <p>you're proceeding along the path to</p> <p>access to the first jhana so when you</p> <p>arrive there it is radiantly clear like</p> <p>moving from a 10 watt bulb to a thousand</p> <p>watt bulb and that dimension of</p> <p>consciousness in the Buddhist view and</p> <p>this is I apophysis but not a Dogma or</p> <p>it can be then it's boring but as an</p> <p>empirical hypothesis this is ruling this</p> <p>dimension of consciousness is one that</p> <p>carries on from lifetime to lifetime and</p> <p>it not the brain is the repository of</p> <p>memories the virtual tendencies and so</p> <p>forth and that's a testable hypothesis</p> <p>and how is it tested tradin a number of</p> <p>people to achieve summative to rest in</p> <p>that substrate consciousness which is</p> <p>not contingent upon the brain perceive</p> <p>the brain carries on after brain death</p> <p>it in the Buddhist view is the</p> <p>repository of memories predilections</p> <p>habits abilities and so forth and so on</p> <p>so here's a very simple test unlike all</p> <p>of the scientific theories that are</p> <p>rooted in materialism none of which can</p> <p>be tested or have been tested utterly</p> <p>contrary to what Ricci implied at least</p> <p>other people say this is a testable</p> <p>hypothesis a scientific hypothesis train</p> <p>a number people the more the better</p> <p>to achieve schemata and then following</p> <p>the teachings of Buddha ghosts of 1500</p> <p>years ago a great tera vaada commentator</p> <p>takes that people at least with sha Mata</p> <p>even better if they've achieved higher</p> <p>states of Samadhi and then have them</p> <p>direct their attention to the path</p> <p>and see if they can retrieve vertically</p> <p>memories from their youth their</p> <p>childhood which is said to be true you</p> <p>can do that and then ask a 66 year old</p> <p>not this one but somebody else there's a</p> <p>chief schemata say now what you recall</p> <p>now that you're you're you're accessing</p> <p>true memories from the time you're four</p> <p>and three and two years old now okay mr.</p> <p>Wallace was the chief janitor</p> <p>hypothetically purely huh</p> <p>now what when you direct the laser of</p> <p>your attention because you've got an</p> <p>attention it's like a laser now direct</p> <p>it to where whirring what were you</p> <p>experiencing sixty-eight years ago</p> <p>perfectly good question and there are</p> <p>three possibility logical possibilities</p> <p>the shona tete-a-tete one who actually</p> <p>achieved it says I'm sorry I'm coming</p> <p>with a blank screen no data the</p> <p>materialist would say I told you so</p> <p>another one to come up with come up with</p> <p>I remember this I remember this and is</p> <p>all fantasy just fantasy you know I was</p> <p>Cleopatra I was Napoleon yeah maybe but</p> <p>there's a third possibility the person</p> <p>comes up the memories and they're tested</p> <p>scientifically by open-minded critical</p> <p>skeptical scientists or anybody else and</p> <p>say okay who were what is your memory oh</p> <p>you were this old man living in Buenos</p> <p>Aires</p> <p>tell us more and then they do</p> <p>investigation they into an investigation</p> <p>investigation and there is a way to</p> <p>empirically put to the test which has</p> <p>been done thousands of times already</p> <p>within the Buddhist and Hindu tradition</p> <p>and Taoist traditions do it in the</p> <p>monitor scientific context there's a</p> <p>dimension of consciousness that is not</p> <p>brain dependent and it's out of that</p> <p>continuum of consciousness that might</p> <p>emerges so we asked for what are the</p> <p>origins of mind is not neurons it's not</p> <p>synapses dendrite 2d glial cells as some</p> <p>as hugly said this is like pulling a</p> <p>genie out of a lamp</p> <p>it's magical thinking or Giulio Tononi a</p> <p>neuroscientist at university of</p> <p>wisconsin said this is like a macula</p> <p>conception the thing that chemicals</p> <p>electricity actually give rise to</p> <p>subjective experience I've studied</p> <p>physics it's it's a wacko physics they</p> <p>know a lot of physicists know a lot</p> <p>about matter and energy there's no</p> <p>suggestion anywhere that they give rise</p> <p>to dreams</p> <p>it's a silly idea that's become</p> <p>commonplace Britta is another order of</p> <p>magnitude beyond that Ripa is</p> <p>transcended substrate consciousness is</p> <p>present era it's within the realm of</p> <p>deep psychology they say transpersonal</p> <p>psychology but empirical but for that</p> <p>you need to develop the appropriate</p> <p>technology and that shaman to realize</p> <p>the empty nature of mind you need the</p> <p>passion to cut through the conditioned</p> <p>mind to unconditioned mind</p> <p>for that you need option the question is</p> <p>how no what is a relationship between</p> <p>devotion and specifically group Korea</p> <p>devotion or Guru yoga and the practice</p> <p>of zouk Chen what's a relationship how</p> <p>important is it and insofar as it is</p> <p>important how do you go about doing it</p> <p>right generally speaking in all schools</p> <p>of Buddhism starting with a foundation</p> <p>Pali Canon the relationship with economy</p> <p>through the spiritual friend the</p> <p>spiritual mentor is enormous ly</p> <p>important it's a guide imagine trying to</p> <p>learn guitar on your own with no guitar</p> <p>teacher learning mathematics just by</p> <p>picking up mathematics books you know</p> <p>can it be done yellen principle there</p> <p>are prodigies who just are self-taught</p> <p>but we know how rare they are so that's</p> <p>for chemistry for learning medicine</p> <p>would you like to have have brain</p> <p>surgery done on yourself by person who</p> <p>read a lot of books on it and I think I</p> <p>think I I think I can do it can I try in</p> <p>your brain you know for any serious</p> <p>sophisticated level of knowledge you</p> <p>want a teacher and serious and</p> <p>sophisticated is a pretty good</p> <p>characterization of the were Noble</p> <p>Truths if your aspiration is to be</p> <p>forever and completely free of all</p> <p>mental afflictions</p> <p>that's nothing trivial about that and so</p> <p>clearly you're gonna be a lot more</p> <p>effective if you find an authentic</p> <p>teacher and relate to this person a very</p> <p>meaningful respectful reverent way but</p> <p>that's true actually for everything else</p> <p>too as we move into end in the in the</p> <p>Tibetan tradition they say if you're</p> <p>following let's say the shravaka path it</p> <p>has to become in our heart view your own</p> <p>teacher as as if he or she were an</p> <p>emissary or an ambassador of the Buddha</p> <p>because this is as close to the Buddha</p> <p>as you're gonna get</p> <p>the Buddha's 2,500 years ago but this is</p> <p>an unbroken continuum a lineage a</p> <p>current</p> <p>of the teachings and the teacher you</p> <p>have make sure you choose well the</p> <p>teacher was authentic is ethical is well</p> <p>motivated has profound understanding</p> <p>it's a skillful teacher and is teaching</p> <p>for one reason only above all one reason</p> <p>that's compassion if there's any other</p> <p>motivation for teaching find another</p> <p>teacher because it's probably not going</p> <p>to be motivation mistaken be to your</p> <p>advantage so first of all choose well in</p> <p>the Mahayana tradition it goes even</p> <p>deeper now view your teacher as if he or</p> <p>she were a Buddha as a conduit of the</p> <p>blessings of dharmakaya or the blessings</p> <p>of the Buddha as not simply a historical</p> <p>character but a living presence and so</p> <p>they're a very deeply spiritual view of</p> <p>the Buddha mind on acai being everywhere</p> <p>present but like light coming through a</p> <p>magnifying glass</p> <p>really funneled through focusing through</p> <p>an authentic my own a Buddhist teacher</p> <p>there's a person with experience of bodhichitta insight of emptiness some</p> <p>experience of schemata skillful teacher</p> <p>knowledgeable experienced and</p> <p>compassionate when we move into Vaudrey</p> <p>jana and then specifically zouk chen now</p> <p>we're doing something quite</p> <p>extraordinary which makes sense if and</p> <p>only if one has some genuine insight</p> <p>into emptiness and genuine intuitive</p> <p>affirmation is very least of the</p> <p>omnipresent nature of dharmakaya the</p> <p>theme that comes in the Utada tantra one</p> <p>of the five works of Maitreya that the</p> <p>mine streams of every sense of being are</p> <p>saturated by Buddha nature saturated by</p> <p>the mind of the buddha indivisibly</p> <p>saturated by so we're your guru is where</p> <p>your gurus mind is there is the</p> <p>Dharmakaya there is rick but there is</p> <p>primordial consciousness so then it's a</p> <p>matter of choice if you're finally in</p> <p>job chen it's a matter of choice it's</p> <p>perfectly didn't for example i some</p> <p>people regard me as their lamas and I</p> <p>teach Doc Chen so for some people I'm as</p> <p>OPM Lama does that mean that suddenly</p> <p>I'm a highly realized perfected being</p> <p>not even remotely but where I am as</p> <p>where Daniel is and where is Kestrel is</p> <p>and anybody else here where you are</p> <p>there is Buddha mind so I'm gonna say</p> <p>that where my mind is there is</p> <p>mind it's true where I am there's also a</p> <p>sentry beings mind like guy from</p> <p>California no that's also true where I</p> <p>am here's my substrate consciousness</p> <p>carried on from past lies we'll carry on</p> <p>in the future that's also here so it's</p> <p>your choice</p> <p>and it's not an invitation to be a guru</p> <p>it's just a choice in general that is</p> <p>you attend to your guru you can if you</p> <p>wish simply regard your rule is</p> <p>essentially you could very well be true</p> <p>you can view that you grow as this</p> <p>continuum based upon the continuum of</p> <p>substrate consciousness but you can if</p> <p>you wish seeing the empty nature of your</p> <p>guru as a sentient being that there is</p> <p>nothing from the grooved side that is</p> <p>inherently a sentient being try to find</p> <p>it try to find in yourself if you ever</p> <p>look within and tried to find that</p> <p>nuclear sentient being that is you and I</p> <p>think I can guarantee you're not gonna</p> <p>find it it is conventionally existent</p> <p>and that's all and so it's a matter of</p> <p>choice where we never thought he we even</p> <p>had a choice but we may if we choose</p> <p>look through the veneer of appearances</p> <p>which are strongly conditioned by our</p> <p>own Karma our predilections our beliefs</p> <p>preconceptions and so forth look through</p> <p>the veneer of the course mind look</p> <p>through the veneer of the substrate</p> <p>consciousness as with x-ray vision look</p> <p>right down to the core the Buddha nature</p> <p>that is there where your guru is</p> <p>dharmakaya that is where there where</p> <p>your guru is and on that basis designate</p> <p>this is my guru my guru is a vodka da da</p> <p>da da da da da da da</p> <p>Samantha bottom Adi Buddha my guru is</p> <p>Buddha because where my guru is there is</p> <p>blood of mind and it's on that basis I'm</p> <p>identifying my guru and for me my guru</p> <p>is Buddha but this goes hand in hand we</p> <p>say well what's the big deal why are you</p> <p>doing it</p> <p>well number one you get a lot more</p> <p>benefit that way but two this is all</p> <p>preamble as a preparation because the</p> <p>whole point of Adrienne in general ends</p> <p>option in particular is to realize when</p> <p>you cut through the veneer of your own</p> <p>self preconceptions your ordinary sense</p> <p>of who you are your ordinary sense of</p> <p>identity ordinary way of appearing to</p> <p>yourself cut through that there's</p> <p>nothing there that exists from its own</p> <p>side cut through that cut through the</p> <p>substrate consciousness and know your</p> <p>own face as rickwaa which has always</p> <p>been present so the devotion the</p> <p>reverence the focus on the Guru as</p> <p>Buddha is really simply the other side</p> <p>of the coin of coming to know yourself</p> <p>as a Buddha now in a way it's very</p> <p>helpful to have an extraordinary teacher</p> <p>I know Daniels teacher going on image a</p> <p>extraordinary master and you see such</p> <p>people as long as the Dalai Lama diggle</p> <p>consider but you do join room which is</p> <p>ona [ __ ] a I've met such people in you</p> <p>standing all of them if you kind of get</p> <p>them say whoa and what comes with that</p> <p>is oh boy he's so much not like me you</p> <p>know when I first met the Dalai Lama</p> <p>it's like whoa he's my guru but boy is</p> <p>he not like me and jung junha virtue</p> <p>vidyadhara oh boy is he not like me you</p> <p>know and got a temper Qi and other great</p> <p>teachers the sixteenth karmapa the</p> <p>current come out awesome beings the</p> <p>current incarnation renews Malinga young</p> <p>man awesome and so it's very easy to</p> <p>feel devotion for these beings who just</p> <p>manifest to us with majesty with with a</p> <p>deep sense of the sacred but in so doing</p> <p>we also have a sense of and then there's</p> <p>me way down here and it actually can</p> <p>support or reinforce the sense</p> <p>aw shucks little old mean but that's not</p> <p>the point but not the point is not too</p> <p>agile eight or to revere the grew as an</p> <p>end in itself all of that is a</p> <p>preparation for realizing your own mind</p> <p>as Buddha mind and so in a way it's</p> <p>actually more potent to have a grew your</p> <p>root guru is opium master who appears to</p> <p>you a lot like yourself maybe even the</p> <p>same skin color to be helpful to have</p> <p>same gender same country same language</p> <p>boy you're pretty much like me a little</p> <p>bit better but pretty much like me</p> <p>if you can view that person there seems</p> <p>so similar to yourself if you can cut</p> <p>through the veneer of that person and</p> <p>seen that person as a Buddha oh then</p> <p>you're right next door to recognize your</p> <p>own nature's Buddha so that's the</p> <p>advantage of having an ordinary schmuck</p> <p>who's qualified suk-jin teacher I've</p> <p>been authorized to teach so check i'm</p> <p>ordinary schmuck that's who I am</p> <p>but I've been qualified to teach auction</p> <p>and I do it with my utmost ability to</p> <p>not distort the teachings so in that</p> <p>regard most I think most ocean teachings</p> <p>are much more teachers are much more</p> <p>realization Linehan but I the advantage</p> <p>of being ordinary monk so what is the</p> <p>sharma to meditation that you are</p> <p>teaching in this course I suppose are</p> <p>you supposed to take awareness as an</p> <p>object or are you supposed to sink back</p> <p>into subjectivity or something else it's</p> <p>not so much matter of thinking back that</p> <p>sounds very closeted ativ or ruminating</p> <p>it's not that Sochi Ahmed is not really</p> <p>thinking back into but it's SEM Nilda</p> <p>baba and that is settling the mind in</p> <p>its unconditioned state not not</p> <p>ultimately unconditioned but</p> <p>unconditioned on a relative sense</p> <p>resting releasing releasing all grasping</p> <p>while maintaining the flow of discerning</p> <p>non conceptual awareness so when we</p> <p>first start the Shama to practice of</p> <p>simply observing the mind we're</p> <p>observing thoughts images memories</p> <p>coming up dujun Linga comments in the</p> <p>passage I would have read to you but it</p> <p>would have taken a lot longer than I</p> <p>anticipated you're observing in the mind</p> <p>with the mind the conceptual mind is</p> <p>observing the conceptual mind so you're</p> <p>basically in it it's like observing a</p> <p>swamp with you know with you up to your</p> <p>neck in the swamp but then as you go</p> <p>deeper into it the cognitive fusion with</p> <p>the activities of the mind diminishes</p> <p>diminishes diminishes and so </p> <p>dudjom lingpa says it's much more like a shepherd watching his flock out in an open plain while the shepherd sit still while the flock moves hither and yon and so that cognitive fusion is dissipating and the sense of the stillness for awareness as you're observing thoughts you invert your awareness in upon itself but it's still likely your awareness is still very likely to be conditioned by your thoughts your ideas your preconceptions your beliefs about consciousness because after all our experience is generally strongly conditioned by our past experience language acculturation personal history and so on but as you continue to release and relax while maintaining the clarity then you're you're not thinking back into but the locus of your awareness the word is Papa descends from it's an ordinary field which is all cut up in dualistic thinking and so forth radical deepened demarcation between subject and object it's slipping deeper and deeper into this dimension of consciousness</p> <p>that is all that's left when you fall</p> <p>down when you fall deep asleep</p> <p>all that's left when you've gone brain</p> <p>dead underway to dying you're almost</p> <p>dead in fact this is the point at which</p> <p>you know the Buddhist doctor said now</p> <p>you're dead when your mind is</p> <p>irretrievably we dissolve back into the</p> <p>substrate consciousness so you're not</p> <p>observing substrate consciousness from</p> <p>the mind substrate consciousness</p> <p>experiencing itself that's non</p> <p>conceptual not absolutely but that</p> <p>resting in the substrate consciousness</p> <p>is unconditioned by gender ethnicity</p> <p>language personal history and</p> <p>unconditioned by the brain that's the</p> <p>high pot and it's a testable hypothesis</p> <p>that's what makes me so joyful about it</p> <p>this one we can actually get some</p> <p>knowledge and not just be bickering back</p> <p>and forth religion versus science</p> <p>religious dogma versus scientific dogma</p> <p>let's break out of that that's what the</p> <p>Dalai Lama was getting at you know and</p> <p>so it's still schemata when you're</p> <p>resting in the substrate consciousness</p> <p>and the type of mindfulness there when</p> <p>you've achieved schemata Boojum limba</p> <p>says this is self-illuminating</p> <p>mindfulness where the substrate</p> <p>consciousness is illuminating itself or</p> <p>in the territory tradition is called ba</p> <p>ba so cipta the brightly shining mind</p> <p>that vivanco which is the ground of</p> <p>becoming from which all the giovanna or</p> <p>activities of the mind including the</p> <p>five physical senses all emerge and into</p> <p>which they dissolve in deep sleep right</p> <p>and so that's still shammed but it's</p> <p>gone very quiet and only subliminally</p> <p>conceptual at a very very subtle level</p> <p>and there's a subtle level of grasping</p> <p>when you achieve Shama it's said to be</p> <p>characterized by three</p> <p>and this doesn't matter whether you're</p> <p>Christian agnostic Buddhist into what</p> <p>have you this is like it said that every</p> <p>smoke every snow crystals every</p> <p>snowflake is completely unique so it</p> <p>said yeah but if you melt any of them</p> <p>then one drop of water is like any other</p> <p>drop of water and so your your mind is</p> <p>absolutely unique there's nobody that</p> <p>has your mind in the entire universe I</p> <p>mean it's an opera very certainty right</p> <p>nobody has your personal history case</p> <p>closed</p> <p>but if you melt and that's determined</p> <p>term that's often used metaphorically if</p> <p>you melt your mind down to your</p> <p>substrate conscious from which your mind</p> <p>arose and which your mind will dissolve</p> <p>when you die then that's like a drop of</p> <p>water that is your direct experience of</p> <p>it now it is conditioned by karma past</p> <p>memories and so forth and so on but when</p> <p>you're just resting in hitch in the</p> <p>Bhuvana or the substrate consciousness</p> <p>upon achieving schemata they're just</p> <p>wreak wallah teas they sell me dopa its</p> <p>blissful luminous and non conceptual</p> <p>that doesn't matter who you are what</p> <p>your belief system is whether you're</p> <p>human or non-human these are the</p> <p>qualities when you clearly illuminate</p> <p>this underlying continuum of</p> <p>consciousness from within itself and</p> <p>it's beyond brain beyond conditioning of</p> <p>this life versus that but it's the</p> <p>ground of becoming so when you take your</p> <p>next birth your next maybe will be a</p> <p>woman or a man who knows what next time</p> <p>your mind then will emerge from that</p> <p>continuum beyond that though that's</p> <p>where the pristine awareness is you cut</p> <p>through that then you're into what's</p> <p>called the fourth time because Rick but</p> <p>is not located in the past or the future</p> <p>and not even located within this this</p> <p>narrow sliver of the present moment it's</p> <p>in the fourth time beyond time it's</p> <p>beyond it's a temporal and non-local but</p> <p>I've wanted to clarify with you how does</p> <p>intention fit into that intention</p> <p>because I associate intention with</p> <p>action from being</p> <p>just see well very important term</p> <p>there's a very closer related term which</p> <p>is highlighted enormous degree in my</p> <p>under tradition Tibetan Vajrayana and so</p> <p>chen is motivation motivation motivation</p> <p>intention very close right and so it's</p> <p>very true in our extra spectrum</p> <p>outward-looking modern society you've</p> <p>ever heard the phrase don't just sit</p> <p>there do something stupid never heard</p> <p>that one before</p> <p>so we are your eccentric civilization</p> <p>for at least the past 400 years there's</p> <p>been a civilization with the Protestant</p> <p>ethic with our conquering of North South</p> <p>America most of the rest of the globe</p> <p>you know through imperialism colonialism</p> <p>and so forth with the rise of the sign</p> <p>of revolution and the project</p> <p>Reformation I mean all these forces</p> <p>converging in on one thing be productive</p> <p>conquer at least but do something you</p> <p>know and therefore invention is always</p> <p>linked to doing something but of course</p> <p>if you become inspired by the teachings</p> <p>and practices absorption will you do it</p> <p>or not it's your it's your choice which</p> <p>means it's your intention but then when</p> <p>it comes to Vaudrey on in particular and</p> <p>so chen more specifically it is said</p> <p>actually there's only one authentic or</p> <p>suitable fit in terms of motivation it's</p> <p>got to be bodhichitta if one practices</p> <p>VAD Rihanna or zou Chen with it with a</p> <p>self centered motivation but I want</p> <p>something for me I'm out for myself I</p> <p>just want to achieve something myself</p> <p>that's your choice but you can't</p> <p>practice option it's a it's a total</p> <p>mismatch it's a total mismatch it said</p> <p>in judgment lien linguist writings in</p> <p>the virtual essence that relative</p> <p>bodhichitta</p> <p>you know the turn well it the aspiration</p> <p>achieved a microp the physic of all</p> <p>sentient beings about a thought for</p> <p>ideal emerges from spontaneously emerges</p> <p>from Ripa and that's intention so</p> <p>intention motivation as just part of</p> <p>mental health you know we can speak very</p> <p>deeply about soake shin but I think it's</p> <p>good to come back to where we just live</p> <p>our day-to-day lives whether in Boston</p> <p>or anywhere else how relevant is the are</p> <p>these teachings which</p> <p>quite esoteric in any way relevant are</p> <p>they for us in our day-to-day lives</p> <p>doing grocery shopping balancing our</p> <p>checkbooks hopefully and just doing the</p> <p>stuff that we need to do throughout the</p> <p>course of the day and I would suggest</p> <p>that we living in modernity</p> <p>it's especially the 20th century but it</p> <p>goes back to the 17th century Blaise</p> <p>Pascal the great map the French</p> <p>mathematician and philosopher he said</p> <p>and I paraphrase very concisely he said</p> <p>the trouble the problem with modern man</p> <p>is our ability inability to say quietly</p> <p>in our chambers even then we were</p> <p>addicted to and I think it is a literal</p> <p>addiction addicted to stimulation</p> <p>addicted to doing addicted keeping busy</p> <p>even if it's keeping busy with something</p> <p>that is absolutely devoid of any meaning</p> <p>whatsoever better that then just be</p> <p>quiet and be still but you know this is</p> <p>wisdom of the ages and it's east and</p> <p>west be still and know thyself</p> <p>be still and know thyself deeper and</p> <p>deeper and deeper but you won't do that</p> <p>unless you have intention Ellen on this</p> <p>note Galecki I'm going to take a little</p> <p>trip off the left-field Greek antiquity</p> <p>Socrates Plato Aristotle these powerful</p> <p>thinkers they're still influencing us to</p> <p>this day that's pretty formidable they</p> <p>do a very short and clear distinction</p> <p>between cadonia and this is over the</p> <p>pleasure we get from the world from</p> <p>family friends sensual enjoyments</p> <p>activity successes prestige wealth power</p> <p>and so forth cadonia</p> <p>good bad neutral is everything but it's</p> <p>Adonia and it comes and goes and you die</p> <p>it just goes right everything you've</p> <p>acquired is lost and then there is what</p> <p>the Greek call eudaimonia genuine</p> <p>well-being and if you don't is the joy</p> <p>we get from the world eudaimonia is the</p> <p>well-being that we bring to the world</p> <p>it's by our way of life by the quality</p> <p>of mind we bring to the world by the</p> <p>quality of insight of wisdom we bring to</p> <p>the world and that can carry us through</p> <p>all the vicissitudes of life and death</p> <p>right but in order to prioritize to</p> <p>place of great value not on the pursuit</p> <p>of eudaimonia but the cultivation of</p> <p>eudaimonia for that we must spend time</p> <p>in stillness as I was forced to when I</p> <p>was 24 years old I was told I had to sit</p> <p>through ten days of goenka's retreat</p> <p>when he gave very little teaching and</p> <p>had a sit for 11 hours a day and it was</p> <p>just miserable seeing what a mess my</p> <p>mind was and I thought if this is what</p> <p>I'm bringing to the world</p> <p>maybe I should clean up my own act</p> <p>before I have any pretence of being a</p> <p>Buddhist scholar or anything else you</p> <p>know and so that time of stillness it's</p> <p>a time for searing honesty and as we</p> <p>have this term genuine happiness from</p> <p>the Greeks I coined a term genuine</p> <p>unhappiness and as he donate is always</p> <p>stimulus driven it's a response to</p> <p>something pleasant</p> <p>there's stimulus driven unhappiness</p> <p>that's also a response to something</p> <p>unpleasant something happens that I</p> <p>didn't want or something doesn't happen</p> <p>that they did want and then I'm a happy</p> <p>that's pretty simple but what about when</p> <p>you're sitting quietly in your chambers</p> <p>as Blaise Pascal suggested and there's</p> <p>nothing good or bad happening to you</p> <p>you're living just sitting in a room</p> <p>quietly and what if while you're sitting</p> <p>there quietly in good health welfare not</p> <p>thirsty not cold not too hard just</p> <p>sitting there if in that simplicity in</p> <p>that solitude of just being yourself in</p> <p>the universe if you experienced dukkha a</p> <p>sense of uneasiness of dissatisfaction a</p> <p>boredom of restlessness of agitation of</p> <p>malaise</p> <p>that's genuine unhappiness because</p> <p>that's what you're bringing to the world</p> <p>not what you're getting from it and so</p> <p>if our ground state is one where you're</p> <p>sitting quietly with nothing coming in</p> <p>Pleasant or unpleasant from the</p> <p>environment and not even thinking happy</p> <p>thoughts or having unhappy thoughts just</p> <p>being present and if you so cultivate</p> <p>the balance of</p> <p>mind then a sense of well-being Springs</p> <p>right from the very nature of your mind</p> <p>itself it's a symptom of a wonderfully</p> <p>balanced mind a symptom of a healthy</p> <p>mind whereas a mind that is chronically</p> <p>and eventually prone to rumination</p> <p>craving hostility agitation restlessness</p> <p>egotism boredom and so forth these are</p> <p>all symptoms the dukkha of that is a</p> <p>symptom of a mind it's fundamentally</p> <p>unhealthy and how we deal with that in</p> <p>modernity I am very sad to say is lose</p> <p>ourselves in work lose ourselves after</p> <p>work in entertainment and then lose</p> <p>ourselves in drugs alcohol nicotine</p> <p>legal drugs illegal drugs and if</p> <p>anything seriously wrong with your mind</p> <p>well after all it's probably a brain</p> <p>disorder to take a drug just say yes</p> <p>and that's what we're telling our</p> <p>teenagers if they have depression which</p> <p>is on the rise gonna ten times since the</p> <p>rise of modern neuroscience which is</p> <p>supposed to solve our problem mentally</p> <p>because they're actually brain disorders</p> <p>the president's gone up ten times over</p> <p>the last 50 60 years and general anxiety</p> <p>disorder disheartened insomnia</p> <p>posttraumatic stress disorder ADHD and</p> <p>what's our primary intervention there</p> <p>are many very good therapists and</p> <p>psychiatrists but over all drugs tend to</p> <p>be the first resort and the drugs are</p> <p>shoot the messenger because these are</p> <p>symptoms of a mind that is not balanced</p> <p>and instead of balancing the mind we</p> <p>smother the symptoms so in very</p> <p>important ways I think we're living in a</p> <p>dark age right now a Dark Age about the</p> <p>nature and the potentials of the mind</p> <p>the source of eudaimonia the sources of</p> <p>true suffering and we're smothering it</p> <p>with work entertainment and drugs that's</p> <p>not a sign of enlightened era it's a</p> <p>sign of an era Dark Age and there's a</p> <p>great contemporary tradition this not a</p> <p>sectarian segment the great contemporary</p> <p>conditions the Sufi the Christian the</p> <p>Buddhist Muslim Taoist and so forth have</p> <p>just a treasure troves of wisdom that we</p> <p>can be drawing on but maybe a nice</p> <p>strong hunch is these content these</p> <p>the traditions each wonderful great in</p> <p>its own right I think they need a kick</p> <p>in the behind from science because</p> <p>religions tend to be complacent</p> <p>self-satisfied dogmatic closed-minded</p> <p>and rigid you know but that's what</p> <p>that's what that's what people do how do</p> <p>the Easter what scientists do that -</p> <p>they fall under the trench of scientific</p> <p>toriel ISM and they don't need an even</p> <p>though they fallen into it they just</p> <p>think they're being scientific science</p> <p>needs to be rescued by the</p> <p>contemplatives and the great contempt uh</p> <p>traditions need to be rescued by science</p> <p>and then we'll see a great union of</p> <p>meaning and truth to the benefit of all</p> <p>without exception so I hope you enjoyed</p> <p>the conversation with Alan Wallace next</p> <p>week we are joined by scholar of Tibetan</p> <p>Buddhism guy Newland who gives us a</p> <p>heartfelt account of the grief journey</p> <p>that he experienced when his wife</p> <p>Valerie passed away I hope you join us</p> <p>for this episode it's so touching and</p> <p>filled with so much wisdom something</p> <p>that is a basis of connection I mean</p> <p>when I talk about in the book this one</p> <p>little situation when I would take</p> <p>Valerie to get chemotherapy and we go to</p> <p>this place at the University of Michigan</p> <p>work everyone was getting chemotherapy</p> <p>and it was like there was some kind of</p> <p>like what do you say not sure there's</p> <p>something peaceful about being in a</p> <p>place where no one's pretending that</p> <p>everything is okay right and this is I</p> <p>think one of the difficulties when</p> <p>people are in the midst of grief or loss</p> <p>is that there's sort of this pressure to</p> <p>maintain the pretense that somehow</p> <p>basically everything is okay</p> <p>so I think almost everybody has when</p> <p>they when they lose somebody important a</p> <p>sense of how hot is it go out the next</p> <p>day</p>

natural state of the ground is free from complexity,</p> <p>And ground-appearances are rigpa-dharmak\u0101ya.</p> <p>The path has always been clear of effort, from the very beginning.</p> <p>When this nature itself is realized, it is the great source of freedom.</p> <p>The fruition is not something separate and set apart.</p> <p>When the result itself is present as cause,</p> <p>Settling completely is calm abiding (\u015bamatha).</p> <p>Any sudden rising is rigpa's own radiance,</p> <p>And vivid awareness is insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101).</p> <p>Directly, upon fading, there's primordial experience.</p> <p>Remaining genuinely is the dharmak\u0101ya,</p> <p>Accompanying awareness is the sambhogak\u0101ya,</p> <p>And the non-duality of stillness and movement is the nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya.</p> <p>This is what we call the \u201cthree-k\u0101ya rigpa.\u201d</p> <p>While remaining at ease, there's no clinging to experience.</p> <p>Vivid movements of mind are freed, ungraspable.</p> <p>Liberated in vivid clarity, there's no post-meditative state of mind.</p> <p>This is what we call the \u201cspontaneously present three k\u0101yas.\u201d</p> <p>Without any

The virtuous beginning: the meaning of the introduction</p> <p>II. The virtuous middle: the meaning of the main part</p> <p>III. The virtuous end: the meaning of the conclusion</p> <p>I. The Introduction</p> <p>This has two parts: 1) the meaning of the title, and 2) the expression of homage.</p> <ol> <li>The title</li> </ol> <p>This refers to the line: \u201cThe Vajra Verses on the Natural State.\u201d All phenomena are</p> <p>by nature emptiness, beyond arising, remaining and ceasing. In essence they are</p> <p>primordially pure, like space. Not produced by conditions, they are uncompounded.</p> <p>This has been elaborately explained as the so-called \u201celement\u201d or \u201cbuddha-nature\u201d</p> <p>(sugatagarbha) in the profound secret teachings of the Bliss-gone Teacher, such as</p> <p>the s\u016btras revealing buddha-nature. The King of Sam\u0101dhisays:</p> <p>Pure, pristine, luminous,</p> <p>Unwavering, and unconditioned,</p> <p>This essence of the sugatas</p> <p>Is the nature as it has always been.</p> <p>As this says, the essence of the buddha-nature has always been pure since the very</p> <p>beginning. Adventitious stains have never been part of its primordial condition, so it</p> <p>is by nature pristine and clear, without any impurity. It is not a nihilistic void, but is</p> <p>naturally luminous. As it does not fall into any ontological extreme, such as existing,</p> <p>not existing, and so on, and is beyond any conceptual limitation, it is unwavering.</p> <p>And as it is untainted by conditions, it is unconditioned. The s\u016btras of the middle</p> <p>turning reveal its nature as the 'three gateways of liberation.' As The S\u016btra Requested</p> <p>by Brahm\u0101 says:</p> <p>All phenomena have the nature of emptiness, beyond conceptual reference.</p> <p>All phenomena have the nature of characterlessness, beyond conceptual</p> <p>thought.</p> <p>All phenomena have the nature of wishlessness, beyond acceptance and</p> <p>rejection. 1</p> <p>In the tantras of the uncommon Secret Mantra this is described as the original,</p> <p>primordial ground, or the dharmak\u0101ya rigpa which is present as the ground, and so</p> <p>on. The Precious Treasury of Philosophy says:</p> <p>This original, primordial ground or naturally arising wisdom, which is</p> <p>expansive and beyond limitation or bias, is empty in essence, like the sky. It is</p> <p>clear by nature, like the sun or moon. And it is all-pervasive in its</p> <p>compassionate energy, like rays of light. These three qualities have always</p> <p>been essentially indivisible, as the nature of the three-k\u0101ya wisdom.</p> <p>If we realize this naturally arising wisdom, which is referred to in various ways, then</p> <p>it becomes the basis for nirv\u0101\u1e47a. If we fail to realize it [i.e.naturally arising wisdom],</p> <p>then sa\u1e43s\u0101ra arises. Basic space has always been unconditioned; it is natural and</p> <p>spontaneously present buddhahood. As all the qualities of buddhahood are complete</p> <p>within it, it is the sugata-essence. It is obscured by stains, so it is the ultimate allground (\u0101laya). And in essence it is primordially pure, so it is the wisdom of clear</p> <p>light. As it is beyond any form of limiting projection, such as 'existing' or 'not</p> <p>existing', it is profound emptiness and the view of the Middle Way. As it is free from</p> <p>all conceptual elaboration, it is the transcendent perfection of wisdom</p> <p>(praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101). And as it has always been beyond transition or change, it is</p> <p>suchness.</p> <p>This original natural state of primordial purity, unaltered and ordinary awareness,</p> <p>the open, unimpeded dharmak\u0101ya, or lucid quality of wisdom awareness, is taught to</p> <p>have the nature of the seven vajra qualities. The Omniscient Rangjung Dorje said:</p> <p>It isimpenetrable to the minds of intellectuals.</p> <p>It is impervious to conventional reasoning.</p> <p>It is true, as it accords with the natural state.</p> <p>It is incorruptible, difficult for the unfortunate to fathom.</p> <p>It is stable, its essence being beyond transition or change.</p> <p>It is unimpeded, pervading throughout, and penetrating all, sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and</p> <p>nirv\u0101\u1e47a.</p> <p>It is invincible, as nothing whatsoever can hinder it.</p> <p>The instructions for pointing out directly the nature of this great and universal</p> <p>precursor to both sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a, the dharmak\u0101ya of the original dharmak\u0101ya</p> <p>buddha Samantabhadra are contained here, in these forty lines of infallible vajra</p> <p>speech.</p> <p>2</p> <ol> <li>Expression of Homage</li> </ol> <p>At the beginning of this instruction of the Clear Light Great Perfection, there is an</p> <p>expression of homage to the extraordinary teacher, glorious Samantabhadra, the</p> <p>guide who has no origin or conclusion. He is the all-accomplishing king of wisdom,</p> <p>the Buddha who possesses the three qualities of self-origination: his buddhahood did</p> <p>not originate in the ordinary mind, his instructions did not derive from scriptures,</p> <p>and his fruition did not arise from a cause. To this glorious, original protector, the</p> <p>author offers homage beyond any involvement with the conceptual mind.</p> <p>II. The Main Part</p> <p>This has seven sections: 1) identifying the ground, path and fruition, 2) describing</p> <p>calm abiding and insight, 3) showing rigpa to be the three k\u0101yas, 4) pointing out how</p> <p>this is spontaneously present, 5) showing how view, meditation and action are</p> <p>purified within basic space, 6) the pitfalls to be avoided, and 7) decisive resolution.</p> <ol> <li>Identifying the Ground, Path &amp; Fruition</li> </ol> <p>The natural state of the ground is free from complexity,</p> <p>And ground-appearances are rigpa-dharmak\u0101ya.</p> <p>The path has always been clear of effort, from the very beginning.</p> <p>When this nature itself is made manifest, it is the great source of freedom.</p> <p>The fruition is not something separate and set apart.</p> <p>The natural state of the primordial ground is free from the four or eight conceptual</p> <p>limitations. Anything can arise within the basic space of that intrinsic nature, or 'asit-isness', just as anything can appear in the immaculate surface of a mirror. How is</p> <p>this? In the expanse of clear light, free from centre or circumference, whatever arises</p> <p>dawns as the display of primordial wisdom, without falling into the limited</p> <p>dimensions of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The natural state of the primordial ground is</p> <p>thus beyond all conceptual limitation.</p> <p>\u201cGround-appearances\u201d here refers to the time at which the yogi directly perceives</p> <p>the ground that is superior in its essence to the indeterminate all-ground of impure</p> <p>sa\u1e43s\u0101ric experience. At that time, all clinging and fixation connected with delusory</p> <p>thought is naturally freed, without being rejected, and this is what we call</p> <p>\u201cprimordially pure rigpa.\u201d Then, when the vajra chains of awareness, which appear</p> <p>as the unceasing radiance of spontaneous presence, are seen directly as objects of</p> <p>sensory perception, that is \u201cseeing the dharmak\u0101ya\u201d. A Dzogchen tantra says, \u201cChild</p> <p>of noble family, if you wish to look into the face of dharmak\u0101ya, become familiar</p> <p>with the vajra chains that are rigpa's radiance.\u201d</p> <p>The line \u201cThe path has always...etc.\u201d refers to the fact that this ground and its</p> <p>ground-appearances are unconditioned. They are not dependent on other</p> <p>3</p> <p>conditioned factors. The line shows that on the path, within the basic space that is</p> <p>free from effort and striving, the very consciousness that would eliminate or</p> <p>cultivate temporary risings has always been pure, from the very beginning.</p> <p>When the primordially pure rigpa of the path stage is realized directly and freedom</p> <p>becomes extensive, there is awakening within the expanse of great primordial purity,</p> <p>the basic space that is the ultimate source of freedom.</p> <p>These qualities of ground, path and fruition are not isolated from one another like</p> <p>separate tent dwellings. As the Uttaratantra puts it:</p> <p>As it was before, so it is thereafter,</p> <p>For it is, by its very nature, changeless.</p> <ol> <li>Calm Abiding &amp; Insight</li> </ol> <p>When the fruition itself is present as cause,</p> <p>Settling completely is calm abiding (\u015bamatha).</p> <p>Any sudden rising is rigpa's own radiance,</p> <p>And vivid awareness is insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101).</p> <p>Directly, upon fading, there's primordial experience.</p> <p>When the ultimate fruition is not yet manifest, but is present as a cause, the stillness</p> <p>that comes from allowing any rising thoughts to settle completely is calm abiding</p> <p>(\u015bamatha). This is likened to an ocean free from waves. Any thought which arises all</p> <p>of a sudden through the radiance or expressive power of the real nature is the</p> <p>radiance of rigpa. When we are vividly aware of this, that is what we call \u201cnaturally</p> <p>arising wisdom\u201d, or the \u201cwisdom of clear insight\u201d (vipa\u015byan\u0101). As all thoughts are</p> <p>nakedly freed, and fade into the basic space of the dharmadh\u0101tu, this brings about</p> <p>primordial experience, in which we remain.</p> <ol> <li>How Rigpa is the Three K\u0101yas</li> </ol> <p>Remaining genuinely is the dharmak\u0101ya,</p> <p>Accompanying awareness is the sambhogak\u0101ya,</p> <p>Stillness and movement, non-dual, is the nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya.</p> <p>This is what we call the \u201cthree-k\u0101ya rigpa.\u201d</p> <p>The first line refers to remaining genuinely in the uncontrived wisdom mind of</p> <p>primordial purity, in which phenomena dissolve, the natural state of the ground,</p> <p>beyond confinement and liberation. When this 'ordinary' state of awareness is</p> <p>recognized just as it is, without 'changing its fur' or 'altering its colour', then, as it is</p> <p>untainted by apparent objects externally and unspoilt by the clinging mind within,</p> <p>that is direct realization of the wisdom of dharmak\u0101ya, rigpa-emptiness. The fact</p> <p>that the spontaneous radiance, which is unceasing and the ground out of which</p> <p>4</p> <p>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a unfold, is not blocked, but arises, while we are aware of it, is</p> <p>what we call the sambhogak\u0101ya. Even though the expressive power (rtsal) of</p> <p>compassionate energy arises as objects, if thoughts vanish without trace, so that</p> <p>there is no opportunity for habitual tendencies to form, and arising and liberation</p> <p>occur simultaneously, then we come to master the great wisdom in which there is no</p> <p>division between stillness and movement. The ceaseless arising of the display from</p> <p>the king-like dharmak\u0101ya beyond transference is said to be the nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya. The</p> <p>\u201cthree-k\u0101ya rigpa\u201d is what we call the inseparability of these qualities.</p> <ol> <li>How this is spontaneously present</li> </ol> <p>While remaining at ease, there's no clinging to experience.</p> <p>Vivid movements of mind are freed, ungraspable.</p> <p>Liberated in vivid clarity, there's no post-meditative state of mind.</p> <p>This is what we call the \u201cspontaneously present three k\u0101yas.\u201d</p> <p>When the mind's 'knot' of dualistic grasping is released and undone the essence of</p> <p>the primordially pure ground is beyond labelling or identification. It is unfathomable</p> <p>by the conceptual mind and inexpressible by words. It is beyond any objective</p> <p>reference that could be described, and the one who might describe it is no longer</p> <p>present. Even if one were to remain in this experience of all-penetrating, unimpeded</p> <p>dharmak\u0101ya, the wisdom that is beyond the limiting confines of hope and fear,</p> <p>uninterruptedly day and night, still it would not feature the slightest thought of</p> <p>attachment to itself. The Omniscient Longchenpa put it like this:</p> <p>When perfecting realization of genuine primordial purity,</p> <p>There is no one who wishes for such realization,</p> <p>And in the realization itself, there is no conceit.</p> <p>The yogi of illusion is thus beyond compare.</p> <p>When movement of mind, which arises vividly through the expressive power of</p> <p>spontaneous presence, is freed by itself, it is beyond identification. As the Thalgyur</p> <p>says:</p> <p>Free from the beginning, there is no basis for repetition.</p> <p>Freed by itself, there is no antidote.</p> <p>Nakedly free, it vanishes as it is seen.</p> <p>As this says, in 'naked freedom' whatever thoughts arise, whether subtle or more</p> <p>apparent, are liberated with mere recognition, through the crucial point of their</p> <p>absence of any real essence. This is compared to meeting an old acquaintance. 'Selffreedom' means that, based on the crucial point of the absence of any antidote,</p> <p>whatever thoughts arise come into being automatically and are freed automatically,</p> <p>like a snake unwinding its own knots. 'Primordial freedom' means remaining in the</p> <p>primordial nature. Based on the crucial point of the absence of any basis for</p> <p>5</p> <p>repetition, the naturally abiding ground has nothing to lose and nothing to gain. This</p> <p>freedom which is beyond benefit and harm is illustrated by a thief entering an empty</p> <p>house. Furthermore, it is also said, \u201cFreed upon arising, there is no before and no</p> <p>after.\u201d As this indicates, when whatever arises in the mind is clearly freed within the</p> <p>space of the dharmadh\u0101tu, it is like the example of writing on water. Just as writing</p> <p>and its disappearance occur at the same time, arising and liberation occur</p> <p>simultaneously for whatever thoughts appear. And, according to the Omniscient</p> <p>King of Dharma, this uninterrupted process of spontaneous arising and spontaneous</p> <p>liberation is a special feature of the Natural Great Perfection.</p> <p>From the perspective of meditative equipoise, in which one does not waver from this</p> <p>natural essence of primordial purity, one is freed from the five aggregates, and even</p> <p>in the post-meditation of the unceasing radiance of spontaneous presence one is</p> <p>untainted by the eight ordinary modes of consciousness. With no distinction</p> <p>between meditation and post-meditation, the name 'post-meditative state' does not</p> <p>apply. Like a traveller arriving at the fabled island of jewels who might search for</p> <p>ordinary earth and stones but will never find them, once we reach a point at which</p> <p>all that rises in the mind becomes the display of primordial wisdom, even though we</p> <p>might search for instances of ordinary delusion we will not find them. At this stage,</p> <p>all phenomena based upon dualistic perception are freed by themselves, even</p> <p>without being rejected. Like last night's darkness, which vanishes spontaneously and</p> <p>without trace in the light of the rising sun, dualistic perception disappears, even if</p> <p>we can not say where it is that it goes. As the vajra \u1e0d\u0101kin\u012b said, \u201cFor the yogi free</p> <p>from limitation, like the dawning of the sun, this is the experience of dharmak\u0101ya.</p> <p>Emaho!\u201d Indeed, if you realize this, it is what we call \u201cthe spontaneously present,</p> <p>unaltered yoga in which the three k\u0101yas are experienced on the path.\u201d</p> <ol> <li>How view, meditation and conduct are purified within basic space</li> </ol> <p>Without any deliberate view, it is beyond dullness and agitation.</p> <p>Without deliberate meditation, it is entering the original 'womb'.</p> <p>Without deliberate conduct, it is free from rigid notions or ideas.</p> <p>One who has mastered this is a \u201clord among yogis.\u201d</p> <p>When gaining this kind of realization, there is no dualistic division into an object to</p> <p>be viewed and the mindfulness that is the viewer. Moreover, it is free from dullness</p> <p>caused by the diminishing of awareness's clarity and the agitation of thoughts</p> <p>directed towards objects. The fact that meditative concentration with a particular</p> <p>focus does not lead to enlightenment is explained in The Lion's Perfect Power:</p> <p>Practising meditative concentration you will not see the meaning of</p> <p>dharmat\u0101.</p> <p>Naturally present absorption (sam\u0101dhi) is free from any deliberative position.</p> <p>Free from conceptual mind, the natural state is equal to the limits of space. 6</p> <p>There is no thought through which objects of reference might be perceived.</p> <p>As this indicates, there is not the tiniest speck of meditation to be cultivated, and this</p> <p>is known as \u201centering the original womb.\u201d</p> <p>When this kind of realization unfolds, it is free of something to meditate on and one</p> <p>who settles in meditation. It is also beyond any particular form of conduct related to</p> <p>post-meditation, as one is beyond all fixed notions or ideas about rejecting or</p> <p>cultivating the phenomena of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a.</p> <p>Anyone who masters the wisdom of rigpa in the genuine state</p> <p>1 of the ultimate</p> <p>nature and who consequently gains power over all the phenomena of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and</p> <p>nirv\u0101\u1e47a in their equalness, is what we would call a great lord among siddhas.</p> <ol> <li>Pitfalls to be Avoided</li> </ol> <p>If you are aware of a thought as it suddenly appears,</p> <p>And can sustain the continuity of recognition,</p> <p>That is insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101) gone astray in character.</p> <p>It can also be referred to as \u201cpost-meditation.\u201d</p> <p>But it's not the freeing of thoughts as dharmak\u0101ya,</p> <p>And we must cut directly to the source.</p> <p>While the mind remains in empty clarity, if you are aware of a thought suddenly</p> <p>appearing and you sustain that continuity, this is the insight that errs in terms of</p> <p>character. It is not genuine insight. It would be fine to label it with the term 'postmeditation'. It is not a state in which whatever thoughts arise are freed as</p> <p>dharmak\u0101ya. Rather, whatever mental afflictions occur first arise as an object, are</p> <p>then noticed with pure awareness or mindfulness, and are finally left to settle in</p> <p>their own place. But this is merely the approach of purifying movement so that</p> <p>thoughts become objectless and without root. What is needed is to cut directly to the</p> <p>source, so that, through the crucial point of freedom in the dharmat\u0101 nature itself,</p> <p>whatever afflictions and thoughts arise do not hold firm, but disintegrate, freed by</p> <p>their very nature in simultaneous arising and liberation.</p> <ol> <li>Decisive Resolution</li> </ol> <p>Rigpa has always been free from conceptual elaboration.</p> <p>Conventions such as 'view', 'meditation' or 'conduct' and</p> <p>Any clinging to them is cleared, without basis or origin.</p> <p>Good thoughts, bad thoughts, and those in between,</p> <p>Without slipping into any such categorization,</p> <p>Are freed upon arising, without any agent to make distinctions.</p> <p>As long as awareness does not lose its own ground,</p> <p>There is no need for anything more than this. 7</p> <p>In order to show how this 'ordinary' rigpa has always been free from conceptual</p> <p>elaboration from the very beginning, the text points out how the conventions of</p> <p>'view', 'meditation' and 'conduct' are like mere impressions. No matter how the</p> <p>unobstructed radiance of rigpa arises, delusory perception is cleared by itself,</p> <p>without any basis or foundation for clinging to it. When it arises as positive thoughts</p> <p>they arise spontaneously and are freed spontaneously. And when it arises as</p> <p>negative thoughts they become the vast expanse free from all limitations. When</p> <p>remaining in the same state, even neutral thoughts vanish by themselves. Not falling</p> <p>into any position related to existence or non-existence, and without considering</p> <p>there to be an agent separate from freedom upon arising, maintain unaltered</p> <p>'ordinary' consciousness, the inexpressible state of awareness and emptiness. If this</p> <p>does not lose its own ground, there is no need for any further, supposedly greater</p> <p>form of view or meditation.</p> <p>III.

with a student asking about this)</p> <p>Here is one method of how to begin. </p> <p>Visualize a four-petaled red lotus flower in your heart center. </p> <p>Imagine that your mind is in the form of the syllable AH in the center of this lotus flower. </p> <p>The syllable AH is brilliant and radiates light. </p> <p>While visualizing this, at the same time also recognize what visualizes. </p> <p>Recognize that which your own guru pointed out as being the state of rigpa, and simply leave it as it is, naturally, while allowing the visualization to continue. </p> <p>In that state, gendy fall asleep. </p> <p>This is not something that happens overnight; we need to train in this every evening when falling asleep. </p> <p>Maintain the visualization while falling asleep, and while in the state of the naturalness of rigpa as well. </p> <p>In this context, the light of the letter AH is called manifest luminosity, and the rigpa that is recognized is called the empty luminosity. </p> <p>In this way, appearance and emptiness are a unity. </p> <p>That is the luminosity ofrigpa. </p> <p>The light is brilliant, radiant white, just like when you switch on the electric light. </p> <p>The traditional image for this is a butter lamp inside a vase, because there was no electricity in Tibet. </p> <p>That is the image for manifest luminosity. </p> <p>The white light is manifest luminosity, whereas the empty luminosity is the primordial purity of empty mind essence. </p> <p>Recognize that. </p> <p>The object that is being held in mind to a certain 157  extent is the radiant white syllable AH, while the awareness of it remains without any ftxation. </p> <p>Simply fall asleep in that state. </p> <p>The posture used in going to sleep is called 'the posture of a sleeping lion.' </p> <p>It's important to lie on the right side, because the channels through which disturbing emotions move are mainly on the right side. </p> <p>To suppress that flow of disturbing emotions, one lies on the right side. </p> <p>When pressing the channel through which the current of disturbing emotion flows, there will be less conceptual thought. </p> <p>It's like when you exhale the stale breath: don't you start by exhaling through the right nostril? The physical body is said to be a city, the city of the illusory body. </p> <p>This body is a big city. </p> <p>There are so many channels, so many winds moving through them - thousands and thousands of channels, and twenty-one thousand six hundred movements of pranas or winds during a single day and night. </p> <p>There are eighty-four thousand different types of mental states or disturbing emotions. </p> <p>This enormous scale of movement is like that of a big city, isn't it? How many microbes are there within this one body? It is impossible to count. </p> <p>Each of these is sentient, so it really is like a big city. </p> <p>The illusory city of the physical body is like Kathmandu! When mainly practicing the recognition of mind essence, the currents called the karmic wind, which means conceptual thinking, are naturally transformed into the wisdom wind. </p> <p>Impure channels are naturally transformed into the wisdom channel, and dualistic mind is naturally transformed into original wakefulness. </p> <p>Usually this is described as the winds dissolving into the central channel. </p> <p>The immense traffic of wind through the different channels all dissolves into the central channel.</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/cognizance/buddhism%20projects/Dream%20yoga/dream_as_it_is/#drugs-dreaming-delusion","title":"drugs, dreaming &amp; delusion","text":"<p>The Buddha sees that all sentient beings are dreaming: they are dreaming the six realms, they are dreaming the four places of rebirth, they are dreaming all their joys and sorrows. </p> <p>When we are on the bodhisattva bhumis, we are just about to wake up from the dream. </p> <p>Only the fully enlightened Buddha is totally awakened. </p> <p>Buddhas see that beings are ignorant. </p> <p>Sleep is only a subsidiary of ignorance; the real stupidity is not knowing our own awareness wisdom. </p> <p>Buddhist training is all about first recognizing this basic nature, then training in the strength of recognition, and finally attaining complete stability. </p> <p>That is the only way to awaken from this dream state. </p> <p>We need to obliterate this deluded thinking, and no material thing in this world can do that. </p> <p>The only way is to recognize the insubstantial identity of the thinker and experience the three kayas indivisibly. </p> <p>There is no other way. </p> <p>No drug, not even the strongest anesthesia, will totally eliminate deluded thinking; it only puts it on pause, bringing it to a temporary halt. </p> <p>The moment the anesthetic wears off, thinking begins again. </p> <p>Drugs also block the enlightened qualities of original wakefulness, the wisdom qualities. </p> <p>Under their influence, there is no wisdom of seeing the nature as it is, and no quality of seeing all that exists. </p> <p>Rather, we are totally obscured by mindlessness. </p> <p>To make oneself mindless and oblivious is not a solution. </p> <p>An anaesthetic that lasted forever would certainly wipe out all conditioned states of pleasure, pain and indifference, but there is no such drug. </p> <p>EVERY DRUG HAS ONLY A TEMPORARY EFFECT, WHICH SOON WEARS OFF.   </p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/cognizance/buddhism%20projects/Dream%20yoga/dream_as_it_is/#mantras","title":"mantras","text":"<p>if you're into mantras, personally I like to listen to the vajrasatva 100 syllable mantra <sup>4</sup></p> <ol> <li> <p>ergonomic positions \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>sleeping lion posture \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>seed syllables \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>100 syllable mantra \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"docs_2021/dzogchen/","title":"dzogchen","text":"<p>aka atiyoga aka great perfection aka great completion</p> <p>analogy: the final summit of mt everest, with ngondro being basecamp</p> <ul> <li>dzogchen slide</li> <li>wiki page</li> <li>tantra</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/dzogchen/#triad","title":"triad","text":"<p>in dzogchen the meditation comes before the view</p> <p>lectures</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/dzogchen/#view","title":"view","text":"<p>pristine awareness vast unlimited</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/dzogchen/#meditation","title":"meditation","text":"<p>cutting through to pristine awareness aka open awareness<sup>6</sup></p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/dzogchen/#conduct","title":"conduct","text":"<p>dream like -

The ordinary mind is none other than The dharmadh\u0101tu, the buddha nature.</p> <p>Look directly at whatever arises and do not attempt to alter it. Simply rest. All the stages of creation and completion, mantra repetition and visualization are included in this. You must learn to distinguish this practice from distraction. If you are undistracted and naturally at ease, this is awareness, where there is neither gain nor loss. However, if distracted\u2014even slightly\u2014you may give into like and dislike and the accumulation of positive and negative action, the fuel to wander in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. Learn to make this distinction between awareness and mind or thought; rely on the stability of the former and purify the latter, gathered as they are like clouds. The essence of the techniques of taking illness, destructive emotion, the intermediate state, and confusion to enhance the path is simply to rest in the natural state. There is no need to bore you with further details here.</p> <p>The accomplished and learned Gangshar Wangpo kindly gave these instructions to the assembled students of Shedrup Dargye Ling, the Thrangu Tashi Ch\u00f6ling School, on the seventh day of the sixth month in the Fire Bird year.

Why are you supposed to do anything? Well, like I said, this ain't none of my doing. When I left out of here going to work this morning you wasn't no part of my plans, but here you is. Doesn't mean anything. Everything that happened doesn't mean something else. What's it mean then? Doesn't mean anything. You run into people. And maybe some of them are in trouble or whatever, but it doesn't mean you're responsible for them. Mm-hmm. Anyway, people who are always looking out for perfect strangers are very often people who won't look out for the ones they're supposed to look out for, in my opinion. If you're just doing what you're supposed to, you don't get to be a hero. And that would be me? I don't know. Would it? I can see how there might be some truth in that, but in this particular case I got to say I didn't know what sort of person I was supposed to be on the lookout for or what I was supposed to do when I found them. In this particular case but one thing to go by. And that was? That was that they is standing there and I have to look at them and say, \"Now he don't look like my brother, but there he is, so maybe you'd better look again.\" And that's what you did? Well, I got to say you was kind of hard to ignore. Your approach was pretty direct. I didn't approach you. I didn't even see you. What I don't understand is how you come to get yourself in such a fix. Yeah. Are you all right? Did you sleep last night? No. Well, when did you decide that today was the day? Was there something special about it? No. Well, today is my birthday, but I certainly don't regard that as special. Well, Happy birthday, professor. Thank you. So you seen your birthday was coming and that seemed like a good day? Who knows? Maybe birthdays are dangerous, like Christmas... Ornaments hanging from the trees, reeds from the doors and bodies from the steampipes all over America. That don't say much for Christmas, do it? Christmas is not what it used to be. Now I believe that to be a true statement. I surely do. I've got to go. You always put your coat on like that? What's wrong with the way I put my coat on? I ain't said nothing was wrong with it. I'm just asking if that's your regular method. - I don't have a regular method. I just put it on. - Mm-hmm. It's what... Effeminate? What? I'm just studying the ways of professors. Well, I've got to go. Let me get my coat. - Get your coat? - Yeah. - Where are you going? - Going with you. What do you mean? Going with me where? Going with you wherever it is you're going. - No, you're not. - Yeah, I am. - I'm going home. - All right. All right? You're not going home with me. Sure I am. Let me get my coat. - You can't go home with me. - Why? - You can't. - Oh, what, you can go home with me but I can't go home with you? No. I mean, no, that's not it. I just need to go home. - You live in an apartment? - Yes. - What, they don't let black folk in there? - No. I mean, yes, of course they do. Look, no more jokes. I've got to go. I'm very tired. All right, long as you don't run into no hassle about getting me in there. - You're serious. - Oh, I think you know I'm serious. - You can't be serious. - I'm serious as a heart attack. - Why are you doing this? - Me? I ain't got no choice. - Of course you have a choice. - No, I ain't. Who appointed you my guardian angel? You know who appointed me your guardian angel. Now look, I ain't ask for you to jump into my arms - down at the subway this morning. - I didn't jump into your arms. - You didn't? - No. Well, how'd you get there then? What? Now we ain't going? Do you really think Jesus is in this room? No. I don't think he's in this room. I know he's in this room. It's the way you put it, professor. It'd be like me asking you if you think you got your coat on. It's not the same thing. It's a matter of agreement. If you and I say that I have my coat on and Cecil says that I'm naked and have green skin and a tail, we might want to think about where we should put Cecil so he doesn't hurt himself. Who's Cecil? He's not anybody. He's just a hypothetical. There's not any Cecil. He's just a character I made up to illustrate a point. - Made up? - Yes. So his view of things don't count? No. That's why I made him up. I could have changed things around. I could have made you the one who didn't think I was wearing a coat. And was green and all that other shit you said? - Yes. - But you didn't. - No. - You load it all off on Cecil. Yes. But Cecil can't defend himself on account that he ain't in agreement with everybody else, so his word don't count, aside from the fact that you made him up and he's green and everything. He's not the one who's green. I am. Where is this going? I'm just trying to find out about Cecil. I don't think so. Can you see Jesus? No, I can't see him. - But you talk to him. - Don't miss a day. - And he talks to you. - I have heard him, yes. Do you hear him, like, out loud? No no, not out loud. I don't hear a voice. I don't hear my own, for that matter. But I have heard him. But why couldn't Jesus just be in your head? He is in my head. Well, then I don't understand what it is you're trying to tell me. I know you don't, honey. Look, the first thing you got to understand is I ain't got an original thought in my head. If it ain't got the lingering scent of divinity to it, - I ain't interested in it. - The lingering scent of divinity. - Yeah, you like that? - It's not bad. Heard it on the radio... a black preacher. The point is, is I done tried it the other way. I don't mean no chipping neither. I mean blindfold, running through the woods, bit in my teeth... Lord, didn't I try it! If you can find somebody gave it a better shot than me, I'd like to meet him, I surely would. And what you think that got me? I don't know. What did it get you? Life in death is what it got me. Life in death. Too dead to even know enough to lay down. I see. I don't think so. Let me ask you a question. All right. You ever read this book? I've read parts of it. I've read in it. Have you ever read it? Read the book of job. Have you ever read it? No. - But you is read a lot of books? - Yes. - How many, you say? - I have no idea. Ballpark. Two a week, maybe 100 a year for close to 40 years. Two a week... I'm just messing with you, professor. Tell you what... Give me a number, any number you like, and I'll give you 40 times it back. - 26. - 1040. - 118. - 4720. - 4720. - Yep. - The answer is the question. - Say what? - That's your new number. - 4720? - That's a big number, professor. - Yes, it is. - You know the answer? - No, I don't. Let me see that. How do you do that? Numbers are the black man's friend... Butter and eggs, crap table. You quick with numbers, you can work the mojo on your brother, confiscate the contents of his pocketbook. You get a lot of time to practice that shit in the jailhouse. I see. Let's get back to you and all these books you read. You say you done read Probably, maybe more than that. But not this book. Uh, no, not the whole... - Why is that? - I don't know. Well, what would you say is the best book ever wrote? I have no idea. Well, take a shot. There are a lot of good books. Pick one. - Maybe \"War and Peace.\" - All right. Do you think that book's as good as this one? I don't know. They're different kinds of books. This \"War and Peace\" book... It's a book somebody made up, right? Well, yes. So is that what makes it different from this here book? No, in my view they're both made up. Ain't neither one of them true? Not in the historical sense, no. Hmm. Well, what would be a true book? I suppose maybe a history book. Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" might be one. At least the events would be actual events. They would be things that had happened. Hmm. So you think that book is as good a book as this book? - The Bible? - The Bible. I don't know. Gibbon's is a cornerstone. It's a major book. - And a true book. Don't forget that. - And a true book, yes. But is it as good a book? I don't know. I don't know as you can make a comparison. We're talking about apples and pears. We ain't talking about no apples and pears, professor. We're talking about books. Is that \"Decline and Fall\" book as good a book as this here book? Answer the question. I'm gonna have to say no. Used to say right here on the cover 'fore it got wore down... \"The greatest book ever written.\" - Think that might be true? - It might. - You read good books. - I try to, yes. But you ain't read the best book. - Why is that? - I've got to go. You don't need to go, professor. Just stay here and visit with me. You' afraid I'll go back to the train station. You might, so just stay here with me. What if I promised I wouldn't? You might anyway. Don't you need to go to work? I was on my way to work. A funny thing happened to you on the way to work. Yes, it did. Will they fire you? No, they ain't gonna fire me. - You could call in. - Ain't got no phone. Anyhow, they know if I ain't there by no I ain't coming. I ain't a late sort of person. - Why don't you have a phone? - Don't need one. Junkies would steal it anyway. Get a cheap one. Don't get too cheap for a junkie. Let's get back to you. Let's stick with you for a minute. - Can I ask you something? - Sure you can. Where were you standing? I never saw you. You mean when you took your amazing leap? - Yes. - I was on the platform. - On the platform? - Yeah. Well, I didn't see you. I was standing on the platform, minding my own business. Here you come haulin' ass. I looked all around to make sure there was no one there, particularly no children. There was nobody around. No, just me. Well, I don't know where you could have been. Fixing to get spooky on me here, professor? Maybe I was behind a post or something. There wasn't any post. So what're you saying... You're looking at some big black angel got sent down here to snatch your honky ass out of there at the last possible minute and save you from destruction? No, I don't think that. - Such a thing ain't possible? - No, it isn't. Well, you're the one suggested it. I never suggested any such thing. You're the one who put in the stuff about angels. I never said anything about angels. I don't believe in angels. Well, what is it you believe in? A lot of things. All right. - All right what? - All right, what things? - I believe in things. - Give me a for instance. Um, cultural things, for instance, books, music, art, things like that. All right. Those are the things that have value to me. They're the foundations of civilization. Well, they used to have value to me. They don't have so much value anymore, I guess. What happened to them? People stopped valuing them. I stopped valuing them to a certain extent. I'm not sure I can tell you why. That world is largely gone now. Soon it will be wholly gone. I'm not sure I'm following you, professor. There's nothing to follow. It's all right. The things I loved were very frail, very fragile. I didn't know that. I thought they were indestructible. They weren't. And that's what sent you off the edge of the platform? It wasn't nothing personal? Oh, it's personal. That's what an education does. It makes the world personal. Well, them's some very powerful words, professor. And I can't say that I got an answer to none of that. And it might be that there ain't no answer. But still I got to ask. What's the use of having notions such as them if they won't keep you glued down to the platform when the Sunset Limited is coming through at 80mph? - Good question. - I thought so. I don't have an answer to any of that either. Maybe it's not logical. I don't know. I don't care. I've been asked, didn't I think it odd that I should be around to witness the death of everything? I do think it's odd. But that doesn't mean it isn't so. Somebody has to be here. But you don't intend to hang around for it? No, I don't. Let me see if I got this straight. You're saying that all this culture stuff is the only thing between you and the Sunset Limited. - It's a lot. - But it busted out on you. Yes. You're a culture junkie. Maybe you're right. Maybe I have no beliefs. I believe in the Sunset Limited. Damn, professor. Damn indeed. No beliefs? The things I believed in no longer exist. It's foolish to pretend they do. Western civilization finally went up in smoke in the chimneys of Dachau, and I was too infatuated to see it. I see it now. Hoo! You're a challenge, professor, you know that? Well, there's no reason for you to become involved in my problems. I should go. - Have you got any friends? - No. - Come on, professor, not one? - Not really, no. - Tell me about that one. - What one? - The \"not really\" one. - I have a friend at the university... Not a close friend. We have lunch from time to time. But that's about as good as it gets? Yes. What'd you do to him? - What'd I do to him? - Yeah. I didn't do anything to him. What makes you think I did something to him? I don't know. Did you? No. What is it you think I did to him? I don't know. I want you to tell me. There's nothing to tell. You didn't leave him a note or nothing - to tell him you've taken the train? - No. - Your best friend? - He's not my best friend. I thought we just got done deciding he was. You just got done deciding he... Did you ever tell him you was thinking about this? - No. Why should I? - 'Cause he's your best friend. He's... I told you, we're not all that close. - You're not all that close? - No. He's your best friend, only you ain't all that close? If you'd like. Not the way you'd want to bother him with a little thing like suicide? Look, suppose I were to give you my word that I would just go home and I wouldn't try to kill myself en route. Suppose I was to give you my word that I wouldn't listen to none of your bullshit. So what am I, a prisoner here? You know better than that. You was a prisoner before you got here... A death row prisoner. What did your daddy do? What? I said what did your daddy do... What kind of work? He was a lawyer. - A lawyer? - Yeah. What kind of law did he do? He was a government lawyer. He didn't do criminal law or anything like that. What would be a thing like criminal law? I don't know. Divorce law maybe. Mm-hmm. Maybe you got a point. What'd he die of? Who said he was dead? - Is he dead? - Yes. What did he die of? Cancer. Cancer. So he was sick for a while? Yes, he was. - Did you go see him? - No. - How come? - I didn't want to. How come you didn't want to? I don't know. I just didn't. Maybe I didn't want to remember him that way. Mm, bullshit. Did he ask you to come? No. - But your mama did. - She may have. I don't remember. Come on, professor. You know she asked you to come. Okay, yes. - What did you tell her? - I said I would. - But you didn't? - No. - How come? - He died. No no, that ain't it. You had time to go see him, but you didn't do it. I suppose. You waited till he was dead. Okay, so I didn't go see my father. Your father is laying on his deathbed dying of cancer. Your mama's sitting there with him, holding his hand. He's in all kind of pain. They ask you to come see him one last time before he died. And you tell them, \"No, I ain't coming.\" Please tell me I got some part of this wrong. If that's the way you want to put it. - Well, how would you put it? - I don't know. Well, that's the way it is then, ain't it? - I suppose. - No, ain't no suppose. - Is it or ain't it? - Yes. Whoo! Let me see if I can find my train schedule, see when that next uptown express is due. I'm not sure I see the humor. I'm glad to hear you say that, professor, 'cause I ain't sure either. I get more amazed by the minute. How come you can't see yourself, honey? You're clear as glass. I can see the wheels in there turning, the gears. I can see light too... good light, true light. Can't you see it? No, I can't. Well, bless you, brother. Bless and keep you, 'cause it's there. When were you in the penitentiary? - A long time ago. - What were you in for? - Murder. - Really? Now who would claim to be a murderer that wasn't one? You called it the jailhouse. Yeah. Do most black people call the penitentiary the jailhouse? No, just us old country niggers. We make a point to call things what they is. I'd hate to think how many names there is for the jailhouse. I'd hate to have to count them. Do you have a lot of jailhouse stories? - Jailhouse stories? - Yeah. I don't know. I used to tell jailhouse stories, but they kind of lost their charm. Why don't we talk about something that's a little more cheerful? You ever been married? Married? - Yeah. - Oh man. What? Oh... Maybe we ought to take another look at them jailhouse stories. Oh my. Hoo! Do you have any children? No, professor. I ain't got nobody. Everybody in my family's dead. I had two boys, but they died a long time ago. Just about everybody I ever knowed has died, for that matter. You ought to think about that. I might be a hazard to your health. Were you always in a lot of trouble? Yeah, I was. I liked it. I think I still do. I done seven years hard time. Could have done a lot more. Hurt a lot of people. I used to smack 'em around, and they wouldn't get up no more. - But you don't get in trouble now? - No. But you still like it? Well, maybe I'm just condemned to it, bit in the ass by my own karma. But I'm on the other side now. You want to help folk that's in trouble, you pretty much got to go where the trouble's at. You ain't got a lot of choice. How long have you been here? Oh, six... going on seven years. I don't understand why you live here. As opposed to where? Anywhere. Well, this pretty much is anywhere. I could live in another building, I suppose, but it's all right. I got my bedroom over yonder where I can get away, got a sofa where folk can crash... junkies and crackheads mostly. Of course they're gonna walk off with all your portables, so you can't own nothing. But that's good. You hang out with the right crowd, you pretty much get over all your worldly cravings. They took the refrigerator one time, but somebody caught them out there on the stairs, made them bring it back up. Now I got that big sucker over yonder... traded up. Only thing I miss is the music. I aim to get me a steel door. Then I can have me some music here. But you got to buy the door and the frame at the same time. I'm working on that. I don't care nothing about television, but I sure do miss the music. You don't think this is a terrible place? A terrible place? Yes. What are you talking about? This place. It's a horrible place full of horrible people. Oh my. You must know that these people are not worth saving even if they could be saved, which they can't. You must know that. Well, I like a challenge. I started a ministry 'fore I got out of prison. Now that was a challenge. There was a lot of brothers who showed up. They ain't care nothing about it. They ain't really care nothing about the word of God. They just wanted it on the resume. - Resume? - Resume. You got some brothers in there had done some real bad shit. And they weren't sorry about a damn thing except getting caught. But the funny thing was a lot of them did believe in God, even more so than a lot of these people out here on the outside. I know I did. You ought to think about that, professor. - I think I'd better go. - Oh, hey hey. You ain't got to go, professor. Let me ask you something. You ever had one of them days where everything was just weird all the way around when things just kind of fell into place? I'm not sure what you mean. Just one of them days kind of magic, one of them days where everything turned out right. I don't know. Maybe.Why? Well, I'm just wondering if it ain't been maybe sort of long dry spell for you till you took up with the notion that that's the way the world is. - The way the world is? - Yeah. - And how is that? - You know, long and dry. But the point is that even if you feel that way, what you got to understand is that the sun don't shine up the same dog's ass every day. You understand what I'm saying? If what you're saying is that I'm simply having a bad day, that's ridiculous. I ain't saying you're having a bad day, professor. I'm saying you're having a bad life. You think I should change my life? - What, you shitting me? - I have to go. Look, just hang with me a little while longer. What about my jailhouse story? You don't need no jailhouse story. Why not? Well, you're suspicious about everything already. You think I'm trying to put you in the trick bag. And you're not? Well yeah, but I don't want you to know it. Well, in any case, I have to go. You ain't ready to go back out there on them streets. - I have to. - I know you ain't got nothing you got to do. - How do you know that? - 'Cause you ain't even supposed to be here. I see your point. What if I tell you a jailhouse story? Will you stay then? All right. I'll stay a while. All right! The man says all right. Okay, here go my jailhouse story. Is it a true story? Oh yeah, it's a true story. I don't know no other kind. One day I'm in the chow line and I'm getting my chow when the nigger in the line behind me gets into it with the server, says the beans is cold. So he throws the ladle down in the beans. Well, when he done that there was beans splashed up on me. Well, I didn't want to get into it over no beans, but it did kinda piss me off some. I'd just put on a clean uniform... you know, khakis, shirt and trousers. And you only get two a week. So I said something to him like \"Hey man, watch it\" or something like that. But I went on. I'm telling myself, \"Just let it go. Just let it go.\" But then the nigger said something. So I turned back. And when I done that, he stuck a knife in me. I ain't even see it coming. Blood's just flying everywhere. This wasn't no jailhouse shiv neither. This was one of them Italian switchblades... One of them black-and-silver jobs. Well, I ain't do a thing but duck and step back under the rail. And I reached out and I got hold of this table leg. And it come off in my hand just as easy. It had this long screw sticking out the end of it. And I went to wailing on that nigger's head! And I ain't quit! I ain't quit till you couldn't tell it was a head no more! That screw was stick in his head and I'd have to put my foot on him to pull it out. - What'd he say? - What'd he say? I mean in the line. What did he say? - I ain't gonna repeat it. - That doesn't seem fair. - Don't seem fair? - No. Here I am telling you a bona fide blood-and-guts tale from the big house, the genuine article, and I can't get you to fill in the blanks about what the nigger said? - Do you have to use that word? - Use that word? - Yes. - We ain't making much progress here, is we? It just seems unnecessary. You don't want to hear \"nigger,\" but you about to bail out on me 'cause I won't tell you some ugly shit the nigger said? Is you sure about this? I just don't see why you have to use that word. It's my story, ain't it? Anyway, I don't remember there being no African-Americans or people of color in there. To my recollection there was only a bunch of niggers! Go ahead. Now at some point I musta pulled the knife out and... and dropped on the floor somewhere. Meanwhile, I'm still wailing on this nigger's head, but his friend has got ahold of me from behind. But I got one hand on the rail so I ain't going nowhere. But what I don't know is that this dude musta picked up the knife and he's trying to gut me. I felt the blood. I turned around and I bust him in the head. And he went skittering off across the floor. And by now somebody done pushed the button and the alarm is going. Everybody's down on the floor and we in lockdown. The guard up on the rail... He got his shotgun pointed at me and he's hollering, \"You! Get on the floor and drop the weapon!\" He's about to shoot me when the lieutenant tells him, \"Hold your fire! You! Throw down that club!\" I looked around, and I was the only one standing. I see the nigger's feet sticking out from under the counter where he'd done crawled. So I throwed the thing down. I don't remember much after that. They... they told me I had lost almost half my blood. I remember slipping around in it, but I thought it was the other dude's. Did the man die? No, he didn't. Everybody lived. They thought he was dead, but he wasn't. He wasn't right after that, so I ain't really had no more trouble out of him. He walked around with his head kinda to the side, lost one eye, arm's hanging down, didn't talk right. They shipped him off to another facility. But that's not the whole story. - No, it ain't. - So what happened? I woke up in the infirmary. They had already done operated on me. My spleen was cut open, liver, I don't know what all. I come pretty close to dying. I had 280 stitches holding me together and, whoo, I was hurting. I didn't know you could hurt that much. And still they had me in leg irons and had me handcuffed to the bed, if you can believe that. Now as I lay there, I heard this voice just as clear, couldn't have been no clearer. And the voice said, \"If it was not r the grace of God you would not be here.\" Man, I tried to sit up and look around, but I couldn't. Wasn't no need to nohow, 'cause wasn't nobody there. I mean, there was somebody there all right, but wasn't no need for me looking around to see if I could see him. You don't think this is a strange kind of story? Yeah, I do think it's a strange kind of story. No, what I mean is that you didn't feel sorry for this man. Oh, you getting ahead of the story. The story of how a fellow inmate became a crippled one-eyed halfwit so that you could find God. - Whoa-ho. - Well, isn't it? - I don't know. - You hadn't thought of it that way? Oh yeah, hell, I thought of it that way. Well, isn't that the true story? Look, professor, I don't want to get on the wrong side of you. And you seem to have a powerful wish for that to be the story, so I got to say that is one way of looking at it. I gotta concede that. Gotta keep you interested. - String me along. - You all right with that? And then put me in the... What is it? The trick bag? - Yeah. - Right. You got to remember - this is a jailhouse story. - All right. - Which you specifically asked for. - All right. The point is, professor, I ain't got the first notion in the world about what makes God tick. I don't know why he spoke to me. - I know I wouldn't have. - But you listened. - What choice would you have? - I don't know. Not listen. You think he goes around talking to people he knows ain't gonna listen to him in the first place? You think he got that kind of free time? Why is it you people cat just accept it that some people don't even want to believe in God? - I can accept that. - You can? Sure I can. Meaning I believe that to be a fact. I mean I'm looking at it every day, so I'd better accept it. Then why can't you leave us alone? Oh, to be hanging from steampipes and all that? If that's what we want to do, yes. Because he said not to. It's in here. - Don't you want to be happy? - Happy? What, you got something against being happy? - God help us. - What, I done opened up a can of worms? What you got against being happy? It's contrary to the human condition. Contrary to your condition. I gotta agree with that. Happy? What, like there ain't no such thing? Not for nobody? No. How did we get ourselves in such a fix as this? We were born in such a fix as this. Suffering and human destiny are the same thing. Each is a description of the other. We ain't talking about no suffering. We're talking about being happy. - You can't be happy if you're in pain. - Why not? You're not making any sense. Oh, them is some hard words from the professor. The preacher has fell back. He's clutching his heart. His eyes is rolled back in his head. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks. The preacher's blinking. He's coming back. He's coming back. The point is, professor, that if you ain't got no pain in your life, how would you even know when you was happy? As compared to what? You don't have anything to drink around here, do you? No, I don't. Is you a drinking man? - Are we about to get a temperance lecture? - Not from me. It's been a difficult day. I take it you don't drink. No, I don't. I've done my share of it in my time though. Are you in A.A.? No no, no A.A. I just quit. I've had a lot of friends who was drinkers though... Most of them for that matter. Most of them dead too. From drinking? Well, from drinking or reasons not too far from it. I had a friend get run down not too long ago by a taxicab. Now where you think he was headed drunk? I don't know. Where was he going? To get more whisky. He had plenty at the house, but drunks are always scared they're gonna run out. Was he killed? I hope so. We buried him. I suppose there's a moral to this story. Just a story about what you get and what you want. Pain... happiness. Let me tell you another one. One Sunday we's all sitting around the house drinking... a Sunday morning. Well, here come this friend of ours with this girl Evelyn. Now Evelyn was drunk when she got there, but we told her, \"Go on and get yourself a drink.\" Well, directly, my buddy Reg... He goes in the kitchen to fix hisself a drink. Only now the bottle is gone. Now Reg has been around a few drinking people in his time and commences to hunt for the bottle. He looks in the cabinet, looks behind everything, but he can't find it. Of course he knows what's happened to it. So he comes back in the living room, sits down, looks at Evelyn sitting there on the sofa drunk as a goat. And he says, \"Evelyn, where you put the whisky?\" Evelyn says... He says, \"Evelyn, where did you hide the whisky?\" And she... Well, Reg is sitting there and this is beginning to piss him off a little, so he gets in her face and he says, And she says, \"I hid it in the toilet.\" That's pretty funny. Oh, I thought you'd like that. And is that where the whisky was? Oh, yeah yeah. That's a favorite place for drunks to hide a bottle. But the point is that the drunk's concern ain't that he's going to die from drinking... which he is... but that he's going to run out of whisky before he get a chance to do it. Is you hungry? 'Cause I can come back to this. I ain't gonna lose my place. No, I'm all right. Go ahead. If you was to hand a drunk a drink and tell him he don't want it, what do you think he'd say? I think I know what he would say. Sure you do. And you would be right. - About him not really wanting it? - Yes. Because what he wants he can't get, or thinks he can't get, so what he really don't want he can't get enough of. So what is it he really wants? Well, you know what he really wants. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. No, I don't. You don't know what he wants? No, I do not. He wants what everybody wants. And that is? He wants to be loved by God. I don't want to be loved by God. See, I love that. I love the way you cut right to it. See, he don't either, according to him. All he wants is a drink of whisky. Now you're a smart man, professor. Now tell me which one makes sense and which one don't. I don't want a drink of whisky either. I thought you just got done asking for one. I mean as a general proposition. We ain't talking about no general proposition. We're talking about a drink. - I don't have a drinking problem. - You got some kind of problem. Well, whatever kind of problem I have, it is not something that I imagine can be addressed with a drink of liquor. Mm! I love the way you put that. Well, what can it be addressed with? I think you know what it can be addressed with. The Sunset Limited. Yes. That's what you really want. That is what I want, yes. Well, that's a mighty big drink of whisky, professor. - That I don't really want? - That you don't really want, yes. - Well, I think I do want it. - Of course you do, honey. If you didn't, we wouldn't be sitting here. I disagree with you. All right, but that's the hand I'm playing. I don't think you understand that people such as myself look upon this yearning for God as something lacking in these people. Sure I do. I couldn't agree more. You agree with that? Yes. What's lacking is God. I am sorry, but to me this whole idea of God is just a load of crap. Oh lord have mercy! Jesus help us. The professor's done gone and blasphemed all over us. We ain't never gonna be saved now. You don't find that an evil thing to say? No, professor, I don't. But you does. No, I don't. It's simply a fact. No, it ain't simply no fact. Now that's the biggest fact about you. In fact, it might just be the only fact. But you don't seem to think it's so bad. No, 'cause I know it to be curable. Now if you're asking me what the man up there thinks about it, well, I imagine he done heard it so much that it don't bother him all that much. I mean, what if somebody told you you didn't exist and you was sitting right there listening to him say it? That wouldn't piss you off, would it? No, you'd just feel sorry for them. Right, and you might even try to get some help for them. Now in my case he had to holler out loud, me laying on a slab in two pieces, sewed back together where some nigger done tried to core me like an apple. But God being God, he can speak to your heart at any time. And furthermore, if he spoke to me... which he did... he can speak to anybody. \"Wonder what this crazy nigger's fixing to do now. He's liable to put the mojo on me. He'll be speaking in tongues here directly. I need to get my ass out of here. He's liable to steal my pocketbook. I need to get my ass on down to that depot 'fore something bad happens to me.\" Hey! What are we gonna do with you, professor? Look, I know I owe you a great deal, at least in the eyes of the world. Couldn't I just give you something and we could call it square? I'll give you some money, something like that. I can give you $1000. Well, that's not very much, I guess. I can give you $3000, say. You ain't got no notion of the trouble you're in, do you? - I don't know what you mean. - I know you don't. I'd just like to settle this in some way. Ain't me you got to settle with. Do you really think I was sent to you by God? No, it's worse than that. How do you mean? Belief ain't like unbelief. If you're a believer and you finally got to come to the well of belief itself, then you ain't got to look no further. There ain't no further. But the unbeliever's got a problem. He's set out to unravel the world. For everything he can point to that ain't true, he leaves two things laying there. Do you really believe everything that's in there... the Bible? The literal truth? Yes. Probably not, but then you already know I'm an outlaw. What is it you would disagree with? Probably the notion of original sin... you know, when Eve ate the apple, turned everybody bad. I don't see people that way. I think for the most part people was good to begin with. I think evil is something you bring on your own self, mostly from wanting things you ain't supposed to have. But I ain't gonna stand here and tell you about me being a heretic when I'm trying to get you to quit being one. Are you a heretic? Is you trying to put me in the trick bag, professor? No, I'm not. Are you? No more than what a man ought to be, even a man with a powerful belief. I ain't a doubter, but I am a questioner. What's the difference? A questioner wants the truth. A doubter wants to be told there ain't no such thing. You don't think you have to believe everything that's in there - in order to be saved? - No, not at all. I don't even think you have to read it. I ain't even for sure you even got to know there is such a book. I think whatever truth is wrote in the pages of this book is wrote in the human heart too, and was wrote there a long time ago, and will be wrote there a long time hence, even if every copy of this book is burned... every copy of it. And what Jesus said... I don't think he made up a word of it. He just told it. This book is a guide for the ignorant and the sick at heart. A whole man wouldn't need it at all. And if you was to read this book, you're gonna find there's more talk in here about the wrong way than there is the right way. Why is that? I don't know. Why is it? Why don't you tell me? I'll have to think about that. - Okay. - Okay what? Okay, go on and think about it. It might take me a little longer than you to think about something. - That's all right. - That's all right? Yeah. I mean, I can take that statement in one or two ways. I'm going to take it the good way 'cause that's my nature. That way I get to live in my world and not yours. What makes you think mine is so bad? I don't think it's so bad. I just know it's brief. All right. I think the answer to your question is that the dialectic of the homily always presupposes a ground of evil. - Man. - How's that? That's strong as a mare's breath, professor. Whoo! Wouldn't I love to lay some shit like that on the brothers. Whoa. It's just the two of us sitting here in private, talking. What'd you just say? Your question... the Bible is full of cautionary tales... all of literature, for that matter... telling us to be careful. Careful of what? Taking the wrong turn, the wrong path. How many wrong paths are there? Their number is legion. How many right paths? Just one. Hence the imbalance that you spoke of. Man. You know, you could go on TV, professor, a good-looking man like yourself. You know that? - Stop. - I'm serious. I wasn't even sure you was a professor till you laid that shit on me. Now I think you're having fun at my expense. - No, I ain't. - Well, I think you are. Honey, I swear I ain't. I couldn't say a thing like you just got done saying. I admire that. And why do you keep calling me honey? That's just the old South talking. It don't mean nothing. I'll try and stop if it bothers you. I'm just not sure what it means. It means you're among friends. It means quit worrying about everything. That might be easier said than done. Yeah, you're right. It might. But we're just talking... talking. - Tell me something. - Sure. Why are you here? What do you get out of this? You seem like a smart man. Me? I'm just a dumb country nigger from Louisiana. I done told you, I ain't never had the first thought in my head. If it ain't in here, I don't know it. Sometimes I think you're having fun with me. You are an asshole! A-s-s-hole! Asshole! Come on now. Now what the fuck are you doing in my motherfucking bed? I don't see how you can live here. I don't know how you can feel safe. Well, you got a point, professor, about being safe anyway. You ever stopped any of these people from taking drugs? Not that I know of. Then what is the point? I don't get it. I mean, it's hopeless. This places is a moral leper colony. Damn. Moral leper colony. Where's my pencil at? I ain't never gonna want you to leave. Put this in my book. \"In the moral leper colony.\" I like the sound of that. I still don't see how you can live here. Why not go someplace where you can do the world some good? As opposed to someplace where good is needed? Even God gives up at some point. There's no ministry in hell that I ever heard of. No, there ain't. And that's well put. Ministry is for the living. That's why you're responsible for your brother. Once he quit breathing you can't help him no more. He's in the hands of other parties. So you got to look after him now. You might even want to monitor his train schedule. You think you are your brother's keeper? I don't believe \"think\" quite covers it. And Jesus is part of this enterprise? That all right with you? And he's interested in coming here to this cesspool and salvaging what everybody knows is unsalvageable. Why would he do that? You said he didn't have a lot of free time. Why would he come here? What would the difference be to him between a building that was spiritually and morally vacant and one that was just plain empty? Mm, professor, you're a theologian here and I ain't even know it. You're being facetious. I don't know that word. But don't be afraid to talk down to me. You ain't gonna hurt my feelings. It means... I guess it means you're not being sincere, that you're being... You don't mean what you're saying in a cynical sort of way. Mm, you don't think I mean what I say? I think you say things for effect sometimes. Mm, well, let me say this for effect. Go ahead. Suppose I was to tell you that if you could bring yourself to unlatch your hands from around your brother's throat, you could have life everlasting? There's no such thing. Everybody dies. That ain't what he said. He said you could have life everlasting, have it now, today, hold it in your hands, see it. It gives off a light, got a little weight to it... not much. Warm to the touch just a little... Life, and it's forever. And you can have it now, today. But you don't want it. You don't want it 'cause to get it you got to let your brother off the hook. You got to actually take him in your arms and hold him and don't matter what color he is or what he smells like or even if he don't want to be held. And you won't do it 'cause you don't think he deserves it. And about that there ain't no argument. He don't. You won't do it 'cause it ain't just. Ain't that so? Ain't it? I don't think in those terms. Just answer the question, professor. I don't believe in that sort of thing. I know you don't. Just answer the question. There may be some truth in what you say. That's all I'm going to get? Yes. All right, all right. I'll take it. Some is a lot. We down to breadcrumbs here. I really have to go home. No no no, just stay, just a little. We can talk about something else. You like baseball? Tell you what... Why don't I fix us something to eat? - I'm not hungry. - How about some coffee? All right. But then I really have to go. All right. The man says all right. You know, ordinarily I wouldn't be this rude... A man come in my house, sit at my table and me not offering nothing. But with you I got to strategize, play the cards right, keep you from slipping off into the night. It's not night. Depends on what kind of night you're talking about. Let me ask you a kind of personal question. This will be good. What you think is wrong with you that you finally narrowed all your choices down to the Sunset Limited? I don't think there's anything wrong with me. I think I've just been driven to finally face the truth. If I'm different it doesn't mean I'm crazy. - Different? - Yeah. - Different from who? - Anybody. What about all them other folk out there trying to off themself? - What about 'em? - Well, maybe them's the folk you is like. Maybe they're your natural kin, only y'all don't get together all that much. - I don't think so. - Don't think so? No, I've been in group therapy with those people. I've never found anyone there that I felt any kinship with. Hmm, what about all them professors? There ain't no kinship there? - Good God. - I'll take that as a no. I loathe them and they loathe me. Well, just 'cause you don't like 'em don't mean you ain't like 'em. And what's that word \"loathe\"? - Loathe. - That a pretty powerful word, ain't it? Not powerful enough, I'm afraid. How come you be loathing these other professors? - I know what you're thinking. - What am I thinking? You're thinking that I loathe them because I'm like them, and I loathe myself. Let me ask you this... Is you on any kind of medication? - No. - There ain't no medication for pilgrims out there waiting to take the Limited? - For suicidal depression? - Yeah. - Yeah, there is. I've tried them. - And what happened? - Nothing happened. - You ain't get no relief? - No. Your coffee's percolated. - Yeah, I know. Does these drugs work for other people? Yes, for most. - But not for you? - Not for me, no. Hmm, what you make of that? I don't know. What am I supposed to make of it? I don't know, professor. I'm just trying to see if we can find you some constituents out here. - Constituents? - Yeah, you like that? Is that a word they use on the streets? No, I learned that word in the jailhouse. You hear things from these jailhouse lawyers and then it gets used around. Be talking about your constituents, some other cat's constituents, your wife's constituents. You take cream and sugar? No, just black. Just black. Why do I have to have constituents? I ain't saying you got to, professor. I'm just wondering if maybe you do and we just ain't looked hard enough for them. They could be out there. There could be some other drug-proof terminal commuters out there could be your friends. - Terminal commuters? - Mm-hmm, you like the sound of that? It's all right. Nobody? - Nobody, no. - Hmm. I'm not a member. Never wanted to be and never was. - Not a member? - No. Look, I could eat a bite. And I think you could too. You break bread with a man, you've moved on to another level of friendship. I heard that's true the world over. Probably. Probably? I like probably. Probably from you is worth a couple of damn rights anywhere else. Why? Because I don't believe in anything? Well, I don't think that's the problem. I think it's what you do believe that's carrying you off, not what you don't. Let me ask you this. Go ahead. You ever think about Jesus? Here we go. Well, do you? What makes you think I'm not Jewish? What, Jews ain't allowed to think about Jesus? No, but they might think about him differently. Oh. Is you Jewish? No, as it happens I'm not. Had me going there for a minute. What, you don't like Jews? I'm just pulling your chain, professor, just pulling your chain. I don't know why I like to mess with you, but I do. Now you need to listen or you need to believe what you're hearing, 'cause the point of where this is going... which you wanted to know... is that there ain't no Jews, there ain't no whites, there ain't no niggers... people of color. There ain't none of that. At the deep bottom of the mine where the gold is at, there ain't none of that. There's just the pure ore, that forever thing that you don't think is there, that thing that keeps people nailed down to the platform when the Sunset Limited is coming through, even if they think they want to get aboard, that thing that allows you to ladle out benediction on the heads of strangers instead of curses. And it's all one thing. And it ain't but one thing, just one. And that would be Jesus. I got to think about how to answer that. Maybe one more heresy won't hurt you. Pretty loaded up on them already. Here's what I would say. I would say... Mm! I would say that thing we're talking about is Jesus, but Jesus as understood as that gold at the bottom of the mine. He could not come down here and assume the shape of a man if that form was not done shaped to accommodate him. And if I said ain't no way for Jesus to be every man without every man being Jesus, well now, I think that would be a pretty big heresy. But that's all right. It ain't as big a heresy as saying like man ain't no different from a rock, which is how I see your point of view. It's not my point of view. I believe in the primacy of the intellect. Mm, and what's that word? Primacy? It means first. It means what you put first. And that would be intellect? Yes. Well, what about the primacy of the Sunset Limited? Yes, that too. But not the primacy of the people waiting on a later train? No, no primacy there. Hmm. You tough, professor. You tough. You see yourself as a questioner. But about that I got my doubts. The quest of your life is your quest. And you're on a road that you laid. And that fact alone might be all the reason you need for sticking to it. As long as you're on that road you can't get lost. I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. Oh, I got my doubts about you not understanding anything I say, professor. I'm fixing to say grace. Lord, we thank you for this food and for the many blessings we have received from your hand. We thank you for the life of the professor which you have returned to us and ask that you would look after him, 'cause we need him. Now I don't know why we need him. I just know we do. Amen. Tell me how you like this. It looks good. This is good. This is very good. Supposed to be good. It's soul food, my man. It's got what in it? Molasses? - Mm, you a chef, professor? - Not really. - But some? - Some, yes. Bananas, of course. Mangos? - Got a mango or two in it, rutabagas. - Rutabagas? Rutabagas. Them's hard to find. It's very good. You know, it gets better after a day or two. I just fixed this last night. You gotta heat it up a few times to get the flavors right. Like chili. Like chili. Yeah, that's right. You know where I learned to fix this? - In Louisiana? - Mm-mm. Right here in the ghettos of New York City. There's a lot of different influences in a dish like this. Many parts of the world in that pot over yonder, a lot of different countries, different people. Any white people? Not if you can help it. Really? I'm just messing with you, professor, just messing with you. You know them chefs in them uptown restaurants? - Not personally, no. - You know what they like to fix? - No. - Sweetbreads... Brains, tripe, all that shit don't nobody like to eat. You know why that is? Because it's a challenge. You have to innovate. You're pretty smart for a honky. That's right. It's a challenge. The stuff they fix... dead cheap. Most folks throw it out, give it to the cat. But poor folks... They don't throw nothing out. I guess that's right. Anybody can make a porterhouse steak taste good. But if you can't buy no porterhouse steak and you still wants to eat something that tastes good, what do you do then? - Innovate. - Innovate. That's right. And who is it that's got to innovate? - Poor people. - That's right. Poor people. You fixing to get an a+. So how you like this? It's very good. You don't think a glass of wine would have been good with this? I do think a glass of wine would have been good with it. But you wouldn't drink it? Oh, I might. Just one glass. Jesus drank wine... he and his disciples. Yes, he did. Says so right here in the Bible. Of course it don't say nothing about him hiding it in the toilet. Is that really a favorite hiding place? Oh yeah. I've known drunks to lift the lids off toilets in strange places just on the off chance. - Is that true? - No. It could be though. Wouldn't surprise me none. What is the worst thing you ever did? - More jailhouse stories? - Why not? Which why not you want to hear? Is bludgeoning the man in the prison cafeteria the worst thing you ever did? No, it ain't. It isn't? What's the worst? - I ain't gonna tell you. - Why not? 'Cause you'll jump up, run out the door hollering. It must be pretty bad. It is. That's why I ain't telling you. - Now I'm afraid to ask. - No, u ain't. Did you ever tell anyone? Yeah. It wouldn't leave me alone. Who did you tell it to? I told it to a man of God who was my friend. - What did he say? - He didn't say a word. But you're not curious about the worst thing I ever did. Yeah, I am. But you won't ask me what it is. - I don't have to. - Why is that? 'Cause I was there. I seen it. Well, I might have a different view. Yeah, you might. You want some more? No, I'm stuffed. Hungrier than you thought? Yes, I was. Good. Is this some kind of test of your faith? - What, you? - Me, yes. It ain't my faith you're testing. You see everything in black and white. It is black and white. I suppose that makes the world easier to understand. You'd be surprised how little time I spend trying to understand the world. You try to understand God. No, I don't. I try to understand what he wants from me. And that's everything you need? If God ain't everything you need, then you in a world of trouble. I don't make a move without Jesus. When I get up in the morning, I try to grab ahold to his belt. Sometime I go into a manual override. I catch myself. - Manual override? - Yeah, you like that? - It's okay. - I thought it was pretty good. So you come to the end of your rope and you admit defeat and you're in despair. And in this state you seize upon this, whatever it is, that has neither sense nor substance, and you grab hold of it and hang on for dear life. Is that a fair portrayal? That might be one way to say it. It doesn't make any sense. Well, I thought when we was talking earlier you was saying that there was none of it made no sense... Talking about the history of the world and some such. Well, it doesn't on a larger scale. But what you're telling me is not a view of things. It's a view of one thing and I find it nonsensical. What would you do if Jesus was to speak to you? Do you imagine that he might? No, I don't. But I don't know. I'm not virtuous enough. No, professor, it ain't nothing like that. You ain't got to be virtuous. You just has to be quiet. Now I can't speak for the lord, but it has been my experience that he will talk to anybody who will listen. You damn sure ain't got to be virtuous. If I heard God talking to me, I would be ready for you to take me up to Bellevue, as you suggested. What if what he said made sense? Wouldn't make any difference. Craziness is craziness. - Don't make no difference if it makes sense? - No. Well, that's about as big a case of the primacy as I ever heard. I've always gone my own way. Ich kann nicht anders. What's that you talking? - It's German. - You talk German? Not really. A little. It's a quotation. Ah well, it didn't do them Germans much good though, did it? I don't know. The Germans contributed a great deal to civilization before Hitler. And then they contributed Hitler. Yeah, if you like. I gather it to be your belief that culture tends to contribute to human misery, that the more one knows, the unhappier one is likely to be. As in the case of certain parties known to us. As in the case. Well, I don't believe I said that. I think maybe it was you who said it. - I never said it. - Do you believe it? - No. - No? I don't know. It could be true. Well, why is that? That don't seem right, do it? It's the first thing in that book there... the Garden of Eden, knowledge as destructive to the spirit, destructive to goodness. I thought I ain't read that book. Everyone knows that story. It's probably the most famous story in there. Hmm, why you think that is? I suppose from the God's point of view all knowledge is vanity. Or maybe it just gives people the unhealthy illusion that they can outwit the devil. Damn, professor. Where was you when I needed you? You'd better be careful. You see where it's gotten me. Oh, I see. That's the topic of discussion here. The darker picture is always the correct one. When you read the history of the world you are reading a saga of bloodshed and greed and folly the import of which is impossible to ignore. And yet we imagine that the future will somehow be different. I've no idea why we are even still here. In all probability we won't be here much longer. Them's some pretty powerful words, professor. That's what's in your heart though, ain't it? Yes. All right, well, I can relate to them thoughts. - You can? - Sure I can. That surprises me. But you could be wrong, you know. I don't think so. That ain't something you have a lot of in your life, is it? - What isn't? - Being wrong. - I admit it when I'm wrong. - Oh, I don't know about that. Well, you're entitled to your own opinion. Oh yeah, here it is. Story on page three. Ah. \"Friends reported that the man had ignored all advice and stated that he intended to pursue his own course. A close confidant stated... \" and this here is in quotations... \"You couldn't tell that son of a bitch nothing.\" Now can you say that in the paper... \"Son of a bitch\"? \"Blood-spattered spectators at the 155th Street station... continued on page four...\" \"who were interviewed at the scene said that the man's last words as he hurtled toward the oncoming commuter train were, 'I am right.'\" very funny. Oh, professor, you an amazing man. I'm glad you find me entertaining. - Oh, I think you're pretty special. - I don't think I'm special. - You don't? - No, I don't. You don't think you view those other commuters from a certain height? I view those other commuters as fellow occupants of the same abyssal pit in which I find myself. And if they see it as something different, I don't know how that makes me special. Mm. I hear what you're saying. But still I keep coming back to these commuters, them that's waiting on the Sunset. I can't help but think there's got to be something a little special about theirselves. I mean, they got to be in a deeper pit than us day travelers... deeper and darker. I ain't saying they down as deep as you, - but pretty deep maybe. - So? So maybe they your brothers in self-destruction and despair. I thought misery loved company. I'm sure I don't know. Let me take a shot at it. What I think is that you got better reasons than them. See, their reasons is that they just don't like it here, but yours says what it is not to like and why not not to like it. You got more intelligent reasons, more elegant reasons. - You making fun of me? - No, I ain't. - But you think I'm full of shit? - No, I don't think that. But I don't doubt that it's possible to die from being full of shit. But I don't think that's what we're looking at here. What do you think we're looking at? I don't know. You got me in uncharted territory. You got these world-class reasons for taking the Limited where these other dudes... all they got is, well, maybe they just don't feel good. It might could be that you ain't even all that unhappy. You think my education is driving me to suicide? No, I'm just posing the question. Well, wait a minute 'fore you answer. Okay, go ahead. I think that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. \"I think that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.\" Very clever. What's the point? The light is all around you but you don't see nothing but shadow. And you're the one causing it. It's you. You're the shadow. That's the point. Well, I don't have your faith. Why don't we just leave it at that? You ain't never thought about just starting over? I did at one time. I don't anymore. Well, maybe faith is just a case of not having nothing else left. Well, I do have something else. Well, why don't you just keep that in reserve? Just take a shot at starting over. I don't mean starting again. Everybody's done that. Over means over. Just walk away. I mean, if everything you are and everything you have and everything you done has brought you at last to the bottom of a whisky bottle or bought you a one-way ticket on the Sunset Limited, you can't give me one good reason on God's green earth for salvaging none of it, 'cause there ain't none. If you can bring yourself to close the door on all of that, it will be cold and it will be lonely and there will be a fierce wind blowing. But you don't say nothing. You just turn your collar up and keep walking. I can't. I can't. You want some more coffee? No, thank you. Why do you think it is folks take their own life? I don't know. Different reasons. Is there anything these different reasons has got in common? I can't speak for others. My own reasons center around a gradual loss of make-believe, a gradual enlightenment as to the nature of reality, of the world. - Them worldly reasons. - If you like. - Them elegant reasons. - That was your description. You ain't disagreed with it. It's them reasons that your brother don't know nothing about hanging from his necktie from a steampipe down in the basement. He's got his own dumbass reasons. But if we could find a way to educate him to them more elegant reasons and make them available to him and his buddies, then there'd be a lot of folk out there could off themselves with more joy in their hearts. What you think? Now I know you're being facetious. I think you're right. I think you done finally drove me to it. Mm-hmm. Professor done gone to laying mm-hmms on me. I guess I'd better watch my step. You better had. I might be warming up the trick bag. You think your reasons is about the world, and his is mostly about him. I think that's probably true. I think I see a different truth sitting across the table from me. Which is? That you must love your brother or die. I don't know what that means. It's another world from anything I know. Well, well, tell me how your world is. You don't want to hr it. - Sure I do. - I don't think so. Yeah, go ahead. All right. It's that the world is basically a forced labor camp from which the workers, perfectly innocent, are led forth by lottery, a few each day, to be executed. I don't think that's just the way I see it. I think that's the way it is. Are there alternative views? Yes. Will any of them stand close scrutiny? No. So do you want to take a look at that train schedule again? If this ain't the life you wanted, what was? I don't know. Not this. Are you living the life you had planned? No, it ain't. But I got what I needed instead of what I wanted. Sometimes that's the best kind of luck to have. Yeah, well... You can't compare your life to mine though, can you? No, I can't. ( Chuckles I just can't. Oh, I'm sorry. I should go. - You don't have to go. - I've offended you. Look, my hide is thicker than that. Don't go. You ain't hurt my feelings. I know you think I should be thankful. I'm sorry not to be. - I don't think no such thing. - I should go. I'm digging a dry hole here, ain't I? I admire your persistence. What can I do to get you to just stay just a bit? Why? Are you hoping that if I stay long enough, God might talk to me? No, I'm hoping he'll speak to me. I know you think I at least owe you a little more of my time. I know I'm ungrateful. But ingratitude is not the sin to a spiritual bankrupt that it is to a man of God. I don't think you owe me nothing, professor. - You really think that? - Yeah, I do. Well, you're very kind. And I wish there was something I could do to repay you, but there isn't. So why don't we just say goodbye? You can get on with your life. Suppose... Suppose I have to tell you you could wake up tomorrow and you wouldn't want to be jumping in front of no train. Suppose all you had to do was ask. Would you do it? That just depends on what I would have to give up. See, I started to write that down on a piece of paper. What is it you think I'm holding on to? I don't know! What is it the terminal commuter cherishes - that he would die for? - I don't know. No no. You don't. You don't want to talk to me no more, do you? I thought you had a thick skin. It is, but it ain't hide to the bone. Why do you think there is something that I won't give up? I don't know. I think any man anxious to get run over by a train has got to have something on his mind. I mean most of us would just settle for maybe a slap upside the head. You say you don't care about nothing, but I don't believe that. I don't think death is ever about nothing. You asked me what I think you're holding on to and I got to say I don't know. Or maybe I just don't have the words to say it. And maybe you know but you just ain't telling. What I believe is that when you took your celebrated leap, you was taking it with you and you was holding on to it, holding on for grim death. I'm just looking for the words, professor. I'm looking for the words 'cause I know the words is just the way to your heart. Well, I can't help you. Letting it all go is the place I finally got to. It took a lot of work to get there. And if there's one thing I would be unwilling to give up, it is exactly that. Is there another way you could say that? The one thing I won't give up is giving up. I expect that to carry me through. I'm depending on it. The things I believe in were very frail, as I've said. They won't be around very long and neither will I. But I don't think that's really the reason for my decision. I think it goes deeper than that. You can acclimate yourself to loss. You have to. I mean... You like music, right? Yeah yeah, I do. Who is the greatest composer that you know of? John Coltrane, hands down. Do you think his work will last forever? Well, forever's a long time, professor. So I got to say no. That doesn't mean it's worthless, does it? No, it don't. You give up the world line by line. You become an accomplice to your own annihilation. There's nothing you can do about it. Everything you do closes a door somewhere ahead of you. Finally there's only one door left. That's a dark world, professor. Maybe you just need to admit that you're in over your head. I do admit it, but that don't let me off the hook. I got no choice. Okay. Maybe you're right. Well, here is my news, reverend. I long for the darkness. I pray for death, real death. And if I thought that in death I would meet the people I knew in life, I don't know what I would do. That would be the ultimate horror, the ultimate nightmare. If I thought I was gonna meet my mother again and start all of that all over, only this time without the prospect of death to look forward to, that would be the final nightmare, Kafka on wheels. Damn, professor. You don't want to see your own mama? No, I don't. I want the dead to be dead forever. And I want to be one of them. Except of course you can't be one of them. You can't be one of the dead because that which has no existence can have no community. No community. My heart warms just thinking about it... blackness, aloneness, silence, peace, and all of it only a heartbeat away. I don't regard my state of mind as some pessimistic view of the world. I regard it as the world itself. Evolution cannot avoid bringing intelligent life ultimately to an awareness of one thing, and one thing above all else. And that one thing is futility. If I'm understanding you right, you're saying everybody that just ain't eat up with the dumbass ought to be suicidal. - Yes. - You ain't shitting me? No, I am not shitting you. If people could see the world for what it truly is, see their lives for what they truly are, without dreams or illusions, I don't believe they could offer the first reason why they should not elect to die as soon as possible. I don't believe in God. Can you understand that? Look around you, man. Can't you see? The clamor and din of those in torment has to be the sound most pleasing to his ear. And I loathe these discussions... The argument of the village atheist whose single passion is to revile endlessly that which he denies the existence of in the first place. Your fellowship is a fellowship of pain and nothing more. And if that pain were collective instead of merely reiterative, the sheer weight of it would drag the world from the walls of the universe and send it crashing and burning down through whatever night it might yet be capable of engendering until it was not even ash. And brotherhood, justice, eternal life? Good God, man. Show me a religion that prepares one for nothingness, for death. That's a church I might enter. Yours prepares one only for more life, for dreams and illusions and lies. Banish the fear of death from men's hearts... They wouldn't live a day. Who would want this nightmare but for fear of the next? The shadow of the axe hangs over every joy. Every road ends in death, every friendship, every love. Torment, loss, betrayal, pain, suffering, age, indignity, hideous lingering illness... and all of it with a single conclusion for you and every one and every thing you have ever chosen to care for. That is the true brotherhood, the true fellowship. And everybody is a member for life. You tell me that my brother is my salvation? My salvation? Well, then damn him. Damn him in every shape and guise and form. Do I see myself in him? Yes, I do. And what I see sickens me. Do you understand me? Can you understand me? I'm sorry. How long you felt like this? All my life. - Is that true? - It's worse than that. I don't see what could be worse than that. Rage is really only for the good days. The truth is there's little of that left. The truth is that the forms I see have been slowly emptied out. They no longer have any content. They're shapes only... a train, a wall, a world, a man... a thing dangling in senseless articulation in a howling void, no meaning to its life, its words. Why would I seek out the company of such a thing? Why? Damn. So you see what it is you've saved? Tried to save. Still trying, trying hard. - Who is your brother? - Who is my brother, yes. Is that the reason I'm here in your apartment? No, that's why I'm here. You asked me what I'm a professor of. I am a professor of darkness, the night in day's clothing. And now I wish you all the very best, but I must go. Just stay a little while longer. No, no more time. Goodbye. We can talk about something else, I swear. I don't want to talk about something else. Don't go out there, professor! You know what's out there! Oh yes. Indeed I do. I know what's out there and I know who is out there. I rush to nuzzle his bony cheek. No doubt he will be surprised to find himself so cherished. And as I cling to his neck I will whisper in that dry and ancient ear, \"Here I am. Here I am.\" - Now open the door! - Don't do this. You're a kind man. I've heard you out and you've heard me. There's no more to say. Your God must once have stood at a dawn of infinite possibilities, and that is what he's made of it. You tell me that I want God's love. I don't. Perhaps I want forgiveness, but there is no one to ask it of. And there's no going back. There's no setting things right. There's only the hope of nothingness. And I cling to that hope. - Now open the door. - Don't do this. Please open the door. Thank you. Goodbye. Professor, I know you ain't mean them words. I'm gonna be there in the morning. I'm gonna be there, you hear? I'm gonna be there! I'm gonna be there. You know he didn't mean them words. You know he didn't. You know he didn't. I don't understand why you sent me down there. I don't understand. If you wanted me to help him, then how come you didn't give me the words? You give them to him. What about me? That's all right. That's all right. If you don't never speak again, you know I'll keep your word. You know I will. You know I'm good for it. Is that okay? Is that okay?"},{"location":"docs_2021/sadhana/urgyen/","title":"Tulku Urgyen\u2019s Thought Free Instructions","text":"<p>similar to natural liberation \"differentiate this practice from distraction\"</p> <p>somone did a study recently, most people are mentally distarcted %75 of the time, i believe the reason for this is that having an actively wandering mind naturally carried us forward throughout evolution, but now there are very little threats arising other than ourselves (the plit is man vs self or man vs man - man vs environment is tyypically no longer a scenario)</p> <p>this information is also in his book vajra speech</p> <p>In 2018 I started simplifying some productivity software I've been working on over the years.  </p> <p>I later found out What I created is basicallyy the same thing Tulku teaches here, someday I'll make a screencast of it.  It is very similar to my vim bujo screencast on youtube.</p> <p>here is my short outline of my own process which is almost identical to what Tulku teaches in this video.</p> <ol> <li>periodically interrupt yourself to check if you are distracted<ol> <li>ironically, in the beginning to train yourself to not be distracted you have to periodically distract yourself</li> <li>your end goal is to lengthen the period between reminders until you no longer need a reminder and you maintain the undistracted state continuously</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>I use a vibrating watch if I'm around people, if I'm alone I have a mechanical timer with a loud escapement that works as a continual reminder, and it dings loudly at whatever interval you set it to.</p> <p>I've also started drafting prototype devices for your pocket or bookshelf that use tibetan bowls along with embedded hardware so you can eventually have an app on your phone to program it to playback sounds or display text and video in addition to the ringing bell.</p> <p>video</p> <p>Tulku Urgyen\u2019s \u201cDirect Introduction to Rigpa\u201d video and transcript:</p> <p>Transcript:</p> <p>\u201cFreeing the moment of seeing, meaning the very moment of seeing your own nature, in the first and second instant or a second afterwards, there is no thought.</p> <p>Is there anything more fantastic than being totally free of thought?</p> <p>Even just that shock because there is nothing else in this world that can totally bring a halt to thinking. You can blow up nuclear bombs and so forth and use all different techniques, but nothing really stops thoughts.</p> <p>But the very moment that you turn your attention to watch your own mind it is evident that it is simply and empty cognizance with no thing whatsoever.</p> <p>And yet there is a seeing of that because mind is also cognizant and these are the primordial original unity of being empty and cognizant.</p> <p>But before it happens we don\u2019t believe that this is really it because it\u2019s too easy. There\u2019s nothing more easy than this\u2014just like that. Okay.</p> <p>Don\u2019t think of anything and totally abandon thinker and what is thought of. At that moment you already seen that there is nothing to see. It is not something you gradually approach like a spirit entering you. This is what is meant by the phrase \u201cone moment makes a difference, in one moment complete enlightenment.\u201d That moment like this,\u2026 is the unmistakened Buddha Mind.</p> <p>Don\u2019t project outwardly. Don\u2019t concentrate inwardly. Don\u2019t keep a state in between. Totally give up any mental effort. This is what the old [something] call utterly or \u201csheer emptiness.\u201d You don\u2019t block your 5 senses. Not at all.</p> <p>Just remaining like this everything is vividly experienced, but if you start to investigate and label you are involved in thoughts. This is what Padmasambhava said in the seven-fold supplication:</p> <p>\u201cno matter what appears in the field of your vision for your eyes, the world and so forth, even though experienced just let it be without any fixation.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, disown everything. Dissolving of subject and object is the pure form of the deity. Whatever moves or occurs in the realm of your ears in sound or the sounding whether pleasant or unpleasant, just let be in the continuity of the sound being emptiness because no matter what you are hearing in the sound it is indivisible from emptiness. The empty resounding beyond arising and ceasing is the voice of the victorious ones.</p> <p>Do not get involved in concepts, leading or following; by leading you\u2019re thinking to yourself. It dissolves naturally into dharmakaya\u2014erm, thinking means our thoughts of this and that. If you just let it be, it naturally dissolves.</p> <p>So, to introduce wakefulness don\u2019t do anything to it\u2014accept or reject, hope or fear\u2014then, it\u2019s enough. That is sufficient.</p> <p>So what you naturally need to train in is to not imagine something by an act of meditating, but also not to be distracted for even a second. Being distracted is the same as forgetting.</p> <p>And it is said on the path of distraction the demon is lying in ambush.</p> <p>The moment you look towards and acknowledge empty cognizance, that is called having recognized.</p> <p>And then there is the continuity of empty cognizance which you don\u2019t need to fabricate in any way.</p> <p>Just don\u2019t forget it. Once you forget and start to think then continuity is lost. The moment you look, empty cognizance is seen and recognized.</p> <p>And then allow the continuity of this seeing to continue and be sustained automatically. Then, for an ordinary person, again a thought occurs. Then, you remember, \u201cOh, I forgot!\u201d Then again notice who forgot and simply recognize again and again you arrive back in the state of recognizing your natural face.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean sitting and straining trying not to be distracted. It\u2019s like ringing the bell once and the sound continues. It doesn\u2019t mean ringing the bell continuously.</p> <p>Once the continuity fades, that means we start forgetting and we get involved in thought.</p> <p>Then again we notice \u201cOh, I forgot! I got carried away.\u201d Then, alright, go towards and again you\u2019re back recognizing and again there is natural stability in the continuous state of empty cognizance.</p> <p>You need to train in that: short moments, many times.</p> <p>We have learned to live in this life through training, how to move about\u2026We have to train while involved in the activities of this life, to move about\u2026 For example while eating, you taste the food, then we start to think about the food and then notice, \u201cOh, I got carried away!\u201d Again, recognize while eating. That moment, you arrive back vividly in the state of the essence.</p> <p>Then you forget again, get lost, you know while walking about, moving around\u2026you can still recognize Buddha Nature\u2026when you lie down to sleep, if you are diligent also recognize again\u2026when you sit, recognize\u2026actually, there is no time when you are not allowed to recognize nature of mind, even when you sit on the toilet.</p> <p>It is said like this, in the naked state of dharmadatu, which is unimaginable, relax in incredible state of awareness, a thought occurs, it arises from yourself and dissolves back into yourself.</p> <p>Any thought that occurs is your own expression, comes out of your own essence. It is only when forgetting the essence that the \u201cexpression\u201d takes the form of a thought.</p> <p>But the moment you recognize your own expression, it arises out of yourself, dissolves back into yourself, meaning dissolves into the expanse of the essence. This is what we need to train in, to become used to.</p> <p>There is no other meditation or object or act apart from that as much as dust mote, even. But, if you forget and get distracted, you are involved in thoughts.</p> <p>So please train in this. That is the practice. This is what rinpoche (Padmasambhava) taught in the past and today he has nothing to say besides this.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/","title":"buddhism videos","text":"<p>this section containes that go with videos on this buddhism youtube channel</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/","title":"awareness","text":"<p>the essence and foundation of meditation is awareness, the more you develop this skill the faster you can master other topics</p> <p>rigpa awareness page</p> <p>sutta 148</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/#cartesan","title":"cartesan","text":"<p>this meditation explores all dimensions, stretch the mind and memories out</p> <p>you can start with north, south, east and west and think of as far as you've been trying to stretch your space and extrovert</p> <p>you can also do this up and down, as well as time past and future</p> <p>inside the body, top of the head, bottom of feet, fingertips, front and back of body</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/#inverted","title":"inverted","text":"<p>inspect your own awareness </p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/#objects","title":"objects","text":"<p>observe an objects and inspect it for awareness</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/#space","title":"space","text":"<p>observe an object, then shift your attention to the space between you and the object</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/#projections","title":"projections","text":"<p>observe yourself or others projecting something that is not there and causing obscuration or other suffering </p> <p>this doesn't mean you stop caring or having preferences, use common sense</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/#rejections","title":"rejections","text":"<p>observe yourself or others rejecting something that is not there and causing obscuration or other suffering </p> <p>this doesn't mean you stop caring or having preferences, use common sense</p>"},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/awareness/#awareness-guided-meditations","title":"awareness guided meditations","text":""},{"location":"docs_2021/videos/emotions/","title":"emotions","text":"<p>enlightenment does not mean you go dull and numb and stop having feelings and bliss out</p> <p>it does mean that you understand the nature of the mind because you stay alert and observe situations carefully without blinders on so you are not often shocked or deluded and unstable</p> <p>picture yourself as a sky with sunny days and stormy days passing by, you are not a storm, you are not sunshine, you are the sky that experiences the weather</p> <p>or a mountain, you are the mountain, in the spring flowers grow on you, then in the fall you get covered in leaves, then rain snow and ice, then it melts and starts over -
