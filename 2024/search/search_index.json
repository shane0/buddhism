Here are some notable examples:</p> <ol> <li>Samyutta Nikaya:</li> </ol> <p>Rathak\u0101ra Sutta (The Chariot-Maker): This sutta uses the chariot as a metaphor for the path to liberation, with the \"dhamma eye\" representing the crucial skill of discerning the true nature of things. It states, \"Just as a skilled chariot-maker, when he has placed a new axle in an old chariot, sees with the dhamma eye: 'This axle will fit in this chariot,' so too, a monk, when he has placed the mindfulness of breathing in an unshakable concentration, sees with the dhamma eye: 'This is the way to the destruction of suffering.'\" 2. Majjhima Nikaya:</p> <p>Satipatthana Sutta (The Four Foundations of Mindfulness): This prominent sutta describes the practice of mindfulness meditation, including developing the \"dhamma eye\" through contemplation of physical and mental phenomena. It states, \"So he develops the mind: 'I will develop the wisdom of the dhamma eye.'... He understands with the dhamma eye, as it actually is, the conditioned nature of things ... He understands with the dhamma eye, as it actually is, the escape from the conditioned nature of things.\" 3. Anguttara Nikaya:</p> <p>V\u012bmamsaka Sutta (The Sceptic): This sutta addresses the concerns of a skeptical individual who doubts the Buddha's teachings. The Buddha encourages him to cultivate the \"dhamma eye\" to directly experience the truth of his words, stating, \"He, having abandoned desire and aversion, develops the dhamma eye. With the developed dhamma eye, he sees directly and immediately, face to face, as it actually is, the arising and passing away of the world.\u201d 4. Visuddhimagga:</p> <p>Buddhaghosa's influential text on Theravada meditation: This manual describes the stages of attaining the \"dhamma eye\" through focused contemplation, leading to deeper understanding and insight into the nature of reality. 5.

While Buddhism encompasses a wide range of traditions and philosophical perspectives, there are several key concepts and practices that could be considered as antidotes to dualistic thinking:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Dependent Origination (Pratitya-samutpada): This concept emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all phenomena. According to this teaching, nothing exists independently or in isolation; everything arises in dependence on causes and conditions. By understanding the intricate web of causes and effects, one can transcend the simplistic dualistic view of the world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Emptiness (Sunyata): Emptiness is a central concept in Mahayana Buddhism, particularly in the Madhyamaka school. It refers to the lack of inherent, independent existence in all phenomena. Emptiness is not a negation of existence but rather a way of understanding the dependent and interconnected nature of reality. By realizing emptiness, one can dissolve the dualistic distinctions between self and other, subject and object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-duality (Advaya): The notion of non-duality emphasizes the ultimate unity or non-separation of all things. This is often expressed in phrases like \"not two\" (advaya) or \"not one, not many\" (advaita). In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, teachings on non-duality emphasize the non-discriminatory nature of reality, transcending dualistic concepts like good and bad, self and other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mindfulness and Meditation: Practices such as mindfulness meditation cultivate present-moment awareness and non-judgmental observation of experience. By developing mindfulness, practitioners learn to see through the illusory nature of dualistic concepts and directly experience the unity and interconnectedness of all things.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compassion (Karuna): Compassion is a fundamental virtue in Buddhism, particularly in Mahayana traditions. By cultivating compassion, practitioners overcome the dualistic boundaries between self and other, recognizing the shared humanity and interconnectedness of all beings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wisdom (Prajna): Wisdom in Buddhism involves seeing things as they truly are, beyond the distortions of dualistic thinking. Through the development of wisdom, practitioners gain insight into the impermanent, interdependent, and ultimately empty nature of reality, transcending dualistic concepts and experiencing liberation.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, Buddhism offers various teachings and practices that serve as antidotes to dualism by emphasizing interconnectedness, emptiness, non-duality, mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom. By cultivating these qualities, practitioners can overcome the limitations of dualistic thinking and experience a more holistic and integrated understanding of reality.</p>"},{"location":"dukkha/","title":"dukkha universal suffering","text":"<p>WHY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF SUFFERING - Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche</p> <p>The first noble truth makes it clear that there is suffering.

Unsatisfactory refers to experiences that are unpleasant, disagreeable, or painful.</p> <p>According to the Buddha, all satisfactory experiences are impermanent and therefore lead to dissatisfaction in the end. This is because we become attached to satisfactory experiences and we crave them to continue. However, all things are impermanent and eventually come to an end. When a satisfactory experience comes to an end, we experience dissatisfaction.</p> <p>The Buddha also taught that all unsatisfactory experiences are caused by our attachments. When we are attached to something, we crave it to be permanent and perfect. However, nothing in the world is permanent or perfect.

Abiding without something to anchor the mind to may seem difficult, for our mind is so used to grasping or relying on something. Nonetheless, we can and should build confidence in our ability to bring about the state of depending on nothing but our pure awareness - our knowing. It's not so much about having self-confidence; it's more important to be confident that there's no self. Furthermore, we are the only, true master of our mind.

Our mind has complete autonomy, undistracted in any condition, remaining watchful under any circumstances. The very mind can sail effortlessly and naturally, and is at ease all the time.

While meditating with the mind ground, we remain aware; in other words, just maintain our pure awareness, without contemplation or visualization.

Let go","text":"<p>Try to abide nowhere, not giving rise to a single thought, for as long as we can. However, as ordinary beings, it is very difficult to maintain a state of mind without thoughts. When thoughts bubble up, do not take any actions to stop them. Do not analyze the quality of our unwanted thoughts, do not investigate why they appear, and do not wonder where they come from. Self-denigration or self-criticism is not helpful either. We can imagine that we are waiting at a level crossing for a train to pass. We sit quietly, patiently, and mindfully in our car. Maintain this knowing and simply be attentive. We do not look at the train, do not think about where it is coming from, and do not ask where it is going to. When the train is passing by in front of our eyes, we simply know it is passing by; our eyes do not fall on the train and our eyesight does not follow it either. At the same time, we are fully aware of the train coming and going, the noise it makes, and the sound of the warning signal. When the train has passed, we also know it has passed, and we can safely drive through the level crossing. When we see the red lights flashing, we know a train is approaching. When we see a train passing by right before our eyes, we know it is moving. When it has passed, and we no longer see the train in front of us, we know it has gone. This analogizes the nature of our thoughts-rising, abiding, changing, and ceasing. No matter what type of train comes, how many passengers it has, how long it is, or how old it is, we do not care. Likewise, do not try to figure out the number of our thoughts, nor their qualities; just maintain our pure knowing, without any differentiation or judgment. Again, the best antidote to deal with our thoughts is to hane no espons at al. Vien the we remain a et them o As our thoughts begin to subside, we vemain aware.

This approach does not suggest that we deny the existence of thoughts, nor that we pretend they do not exist. The principle ofletting go teaches us that the nature of thoughts is provisional and deceiving. A thought is provisional because it merely exist for a fleeting moment. Since it will disappear anyway, why do we waste our time confronting it? It is deceptive and elusive, because it is not what we really see. Since it is delusional, why do we try to reject or hold onto something inexistent? Positive thoughts are like sparklers, beautiful but ephemeral. Negative thoughts are like the dummies in a haunted house at a theme park, frightening but unreal. When we remain calm and unmoved, our thoughts have no power over us. When we maintain mindfulness and true knowing, we can deconstruct the falsehood of thoughts. Seeing through our thoughts, we are freed from them. If we pay attention to a thought, we create more thoughts' All thoughts, arising and ceasing, symbolize the endless births and deaths we experience in this lifetime. This lifetime of cyclic rebirth brings us afflictions and suffering. Our mind is busy every day and at every moment. Constantly, we are trapped in a state of confusion, turidity, and confinement. Keep in mine that wandering thoughts have nothing to do with enlightenment ment; therefore, just let them rise and cease.

We may also feel ineffable Dharma joy deep inside. Although this signifies our progress in meditation, do not cling to it or be too happy about it. Just maintain the pure knowing, and remember the teaching in The Diamond Sutra that \"all appearances are illusory.\" Otherwise, we might give rise to something like pride-an obstacle, impeding our further achievement. Furthermore, as a Chan saying goes, \"When seeing a buddha, kill the buddha. When seeing a mara, kill the mara.\" Do not fall into the dichotomy of buddha and mara, good and evil, enlightenment and delusion, and the likes. Our original mind is the mind of the middle way.

Seek nothing and obtain nothing","text":"<p>The Platform Sutra states, \"There is no cultivation or attain-ment; there is no defilement or impurity. Each and every being is innately enlightened, for we all have buddha nature and are originally awakened. Nothing can be established in the orig inally pure mind. Hence, there is no enlightenment to attain. If we want to be awakened, or if we anticipate the moment of becoming enlightened, we are \"defiling\" our pure mind; these clouds of attachment and delusion prevent us from seeing the bright moon of our inherently true nature. Afflictions are ungraspable. Therefore, there is no need to look for enlightenment or purify our mind. Also, as The Vimalakirti Sutra teaches us, do not be attached to, or search for the Three Jewels. Just be in the present moment to reveal and realize our innate buddha nature. We need to let go of Dharma as well as non-Dharma. This is a practice of sudden enlightenment. It is quite a challenge to maintain pure awareness and constantly abide in the state of no-thought. If we feel sleepy, we may switch to the method of breath counting to awaken ourselves again. If our mind is scattered, we may observe our breath in order to bring our mind back. If our mind is clouded, we may contemplate on the impermanent, empty nature of phenomena. If we feel bored or dull, we may look at the buddha statue and use his example of perfect compassion, wisdom, and vows to motivate us to be diligent. These are temporary antidotes to the problems we encounter in meditation. When our mind is awake and alert again, we can go back to the mind ground practice and naturally abide in our pure nature. A passage in The Perfect Enlightenment Sutra summarizes the practice of mind ground: \"At all times, do not give rise to deluded thoughts nor try to extinguish any deluded thought. In a deluded state, do not discern it. Without discernment, make no differentiation either.\" This is the practice of following awareness, practicing in accord with perfect, luminous, pure awareness. It is a practice with no thoughts, conditions, deliberate efforts, attributes, or discriminations. This practice also resonates with the middle way reality. With persistent practice, eventually we will achieve the goal of perfect enlightenment: awakening the mind to see its true nature; seeing the true nature, one becomes a buddha.</p> <p>When we see the red lights flashing, we know a train is approaching. When we see a train passing by right before our eyes, we know it is moving. When it has passed, and we no longer see the train in front of us, we know it has gone. This analogizes the nature of our thoughts-rising, abiding, changing, and ceasing. No matter what type of train comes, how many passengers it has, how long it is, or how old it is, we do not care. Likewise, do not try to figure out the number of our thoughts, nor their qualities; just maintain our pure knowing, without any differentiation or judgment.</p>"},{"location":"mind_ground/#first-letter-memorization","title":"first letter memorization","text":"<pre><code>codie\nrfmc\nbaas\nan\nlg\naeimaiai\nsnaon\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"mind_seal/","title":"the mind seal of prajna wisdom","text":"<ul> <li>audiobook</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mind_seal/#preface","title":"Preface","text":""},{"location":"mind_seal/#1-cultivators-should-thus-abide-and-subdue-their-minds","title":"1 Cultivators should thus abide and subdue their minds","text":"<ul> <li>Fear not the arising of thought, only the absence of awareness</li> <li>The threefold enlightenment is comprised of self-enlightenment, enlightening others, and perfect enlightenment.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mind_seal/#nightly","title":"nightly","text":"<ul> <li>in stillness rest all thoughts</li> <li>recite the diamond sutra with respect</li> <li>refrain conceptual thinking</li> <li>keep a natural pace</li> <li>if the mind gets distracted return to the sutra</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mind_seal/#bring-forth-awareness-that-all-appearances-are-illusory","title":"bring forth awareness that all appearances are illusory","text":"<p>What does it mean to bring forth awareness when perceiving objects?</p> <p>It means that whenever we make contact with the sense objects, immediately bring forth our intrinsic awareness and see through them with the teaching stated in The Diamond Sutra, \"all appearances are illusory\"' Give rise to this awareness and bring the mind back [from the objects of perception|\"-this is the mind-ground ( L Itt xin-di) practice.</p>"},{"location":"mind_seal/#abide-in-nothing","title":"abide in nothing","text":"<p>What does it mean to \"abide in nothing whatsoever?\"</p> <p>It means that our six senses-eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind\u2014do not abide in or cling to the six sense objects of form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharmas.

Let's explore how different types fare in this context:</p> <ol> <li>Classification Trees:</li> </ol> <p>Strengths:</p> <p>Personalized Guidance: Based on user input like mood, experience level, or desired meditation goals, the tree can branch to specific techniques or practices. Imagine a user feeling stressed selecting a calming breathwork sequence, while someone seeking focus chooses mantra meditation. Adaptive Adjustments: If a user encounters difficulties during meditation, the tree can offer troubleshooting steps or suggest alternative approaches based on their reported struggles. Weaknesses:</p> <p>Overly Complex Flow: With too many potential paths, the decision tree can become overwhelming and hinder the meditative state's simplicity. Limited Nuance: Meditation often involves subtle shifts and adjustments. A classification tree might struggle to capture these nuances effectively. 2. Regression Trees:</p> <p>Strengths:</p> <p>Optimal Timing: Based on a user's progress or meditation duration, the tree can suggest adjustments like extending focus on the breath or transitioning to a different practice for deeper mindfulness. Weaknesses:</p> <p>Over-reliance on Data: The accuracy of recommendations depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data used to build the tree. Limited data can lead to inaccurate or misleading suggestions. Loss of Organic Flow: Constant prompts and adjustments from the tree might disrupt the natural flow of meditation and hinder user autonomy. 3.

Weaknesses:</p> <p>Complexity and Interpretability: Conditional inference trees can be intricate and challenging to understand for users and instructors alike, making it difficult to adjust or personalize instructions effectively.

Weaknesses:</p> <p>Rigid Flow: This approach might not cater well to spontaneous adjustments or individual variations in meditation practice, potentially forcing users into a less flexible framework.

Overall:</p> <p>Decision trees can be valuable tools for creating adaptive and personalized meditation instructions, but it's crucial to consider their limitations and choose the appropriate type based on the specific meditation focus and desired user experience. Remember, the human touch and individual intuition remain essential elements in guiding effective meditation practice.</p> <p>Additional Considerations:</p> <p>Combine with Human Expertise: Use decision trees alongside human instructors or mindfulness coaches for a balanced approach. Focus on Simplicity: Prioritize clear and concise instructions, even with branching paths, to avoid overwhelming users. Promote User Autonomy: Encourage users to explore and adapt instructions based on their own needs and preferences. Remember, the ultimate goal is to empower individuals to find their unique pathway to inner peace and mindfulness. While decision trees can offer valuable support, the heart of meditation lies in self-exploration and mindful awareness.</p>","tags":["draft","nlp","diamond sutra"]},{"location":"mind_seal_nlp/#other-options","title":"other options","text":"<p>what would be better for instructions that a decision tree? meditation is a series of monitors and decisions based on the monitors Here are several approaches that could be better suited for meditation instructions than decision trees, given the emphasis on internal monitoring and subtle adjustments:</p> <ol> <li>Open-Ended Guidance with Key Anchors:</li> </ol> <p>Provide a broad framework of key elements to focus on (e.g., breath, body sensations, thoughts, emotions). Offer gentle suggestions for exploration and self-discovery within those elements, inviting individual adjustments. Example: \"Bring your attention to the sensations of the breath, noticing the rise and fall of the abdomen. If your mind wanders, gently guide it back without judgment.\" 2. Mindfulness-Based Approaches:</p> <p>Incorporate techniques from mindfulness-based practices like Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Emphasize non-judgmental observation of thoughts, feelings, and sensations as they arise and pass. Cultivate an attitude of acceptance and curiosity, rather than trying to control or change experiences. 3. Guided Meditations with Flexibility:</p> <p>Offer audio or written recordings that guide users through specific meditation techniques, but emphasize the freedom to adapt the practice to individual needs. Encourage pausing or rewinding the guidance as needed, or personalizing the practice based on current experiences. 4. Interactive Feedback Loops:</p> <p>Design systems that track user progress or responses during meditation (e.g., through biofeedback sensors or self-reported ratings). Provide subtle, non-intrusive prompts or suggestions based on this feedback, but always allow users to override or ignore them. Focus on supporting self-awareness and mindful decision-making, rather than imposing rigid pathways. 5. Visual Metaphors and Analogies:</p> <p>Use imagery or metaphors to guide attention and explore different meditation techniques. Example: \"Imagine your thoughts as clouds passing through the sky, or your breath as waves gently washing on a shore.\" 6. Embodied Practices:</p> <p>Incorporate movement, gentle stretching, or specific postures to enhance body awareness and promote relaxation. Guide users to focus on the physical sensations of the body as a way to anchor attention and cultivate present-moment awareness. 7. Reflective Journaling:</p> <p>Encourage users to write about their meditation experiences, insights, and challenges. Prompt them to explore patterns, identify areas for growth, and develop personalized strategies for deepening their practice. Key Considerations:</p> <p>Prioritize simplicity and clarity in instructions, avoiding overly complex or technical language. Encourage exploration and experimentation, as each individual's meditation journey is unique. Foster a sense of self-compassion and acceptance, as meditation is a practice of patience and non-judgment. Ultimately, the best approach for meditation instructions is the one that resonates most deeply with the individual and supports their personal growth and well-being.</p>","tags":["draft","nlp","diamond sutra"]},{"location":"mind_seal_nlp/#checks","title":"checks","text":"<p>are you familiar with the book mind seal of prajna paramita by wei cheuh?

While gathering wisdom from various sections can be rewarding, it's also true that having a more consolidated and organized reference can be helpful for practical implementation.</p> <p>Here are some ideas for approaching the book's scattered meditation instructions:</p> <ol> <li>Create a Summary or Mind Map:</li> </ol> <p>Dedicate a notebook or digital document to summarizing key meditation decision points from the book. Organize your notes by theme, such as \"monitoring breath,\" \"dealing with distractions,\" or \"adjusting posture.\" Use mind mapping tools or visual diagrams to connect related ideas and create a clear overview. 2. Focus on Specific Practices:</p> <p>Identify specific meditation practices mentioned in the book, like mindfulness of the breath, walking meditation, or koan contemplation. Extract all related instructions and decision points for each practice, creating dedicated sections in your summary. This can help you tailor your practice sessions based on the specific technique you choose. 3. Use a Reading Journal or Reflection Prompts:</p> <p>As you read the book, actively engage with the text by taking notes, highlighting passages, and writing down questions. Use prompts like \"What are the key decisions I should make during this practice?\" or \"How can I apply this teaching to my next meditation session?\" Reflecting on your reading experience can help you internalize and integrate the scattered instructions. 4. Seek Additional Resources:</p> <p>Supplement your understanding by consulting other meditation guides or commentaries on the Diamond Sutra. Look for online resources or audio recordings that offer structured meditation instructions based on similar principles. Engaging with diverse perspectives can enrich your understanding and offer different angles on the decision-making process in meditation.

How many have moved away, disappearing from our lives forever?.. At one time we felt happy just being near a person we loved. Just to hold that person's hand made us feel wonderful.

It's not simply about pinpointing a single origin but understanding the dynamic interplay of mental and physical phenomena that fuel the cycle of suffering.</p> <p>Here's how Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche's quote illuminates this concept:</p> <ul> <li>Suffering is inherent: The first noble truth acknowledges that suffering is an unavoidable part of human existence. It encompasses physical pain, emotional distress, and the ever-present dissatisfaction with impermanence.</li> <li>Eliminating suffering through causation: Recognizing this pervasiveness is crucial, but the real power lies in the second noble truth: understanding the chain of causation that perpetuates suffering. This chain, consisting of twelve \"links,\" describes the intricate dance of ignorance, craving, grasping, and other mental processes that lead to suffering.</li> <li>Breaking the chain at its root: By focusing on disrupting the links in this chain, we can prevent suffering from arising in the first place. Removing the causes becomes the key to ending the cycle, not just addressing the pain itself.</li> </ul> <p>Therefore, universal origination empowers us with agency. It doesn't paint a hopeless picture of inevitable suffering but reveals a path to liberation through understanding and dismantling the very structure that sustains it.</p> <p>Understanding this concept is a cornerstone of Buddhist practice. Through meditation and mindfulness, we cultivate insights into the interconnectedness of our experiences and learn to loosen the grip of desire and aversion, the fuel for suffering's fire. In doing so, we find an alternative to simply enduring suffering \u2013 we learn to dissolve its very roots and step into a more peaceful and liberated state of being.</p>","tags":["false views","level 1","dukkha","samudaya","magga","kleshas","nirodha","noble truths"]},{"location":"samudaya/#the-three-root-causes-of-suffering","title":"the three root causes of suffering","text":"<p>According to Buddhist teachings, the three root causes of suffering are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Ignorance (Avidya): This refers to a lack of understanding of the true nature of reality. Ignorance leads to us clinging to the illusion of a permanent, unchanging self, which is the source of much suffering.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attachment (Tanha): This refers to the craving for things that are ultimately impermanent and unsatisfying. Attachment leads to us constantly chasing after things that cannot truly satisfy us, which results in frustration and disappointment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aversion (Dvesha): This refers to the aversion to things that we dislike or fear. Aversion leads to us pushing away from things that we don't want to experience, which creates tension and suffering.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The Buddha taught that the only way to escape from suffering is to let go of ignorance, attachment, and aversion. By cultivating wisdom, compassion, and acceptance, we can begin to see the world as it truly is and find peace and liberation from suffering.</p>","tags":["false views","level 1","dukkha","samudaya","magga","kleshas","nirodha","noble truths"]},{"location":"samudaya/#suttas","title":"suttas","text":"<p>Several Buddhist sutras discuss meditation practices related to the 12 links of dependent origination (prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da), but two stand out for their focused and detailed guidance:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sutta Nipata 16: Paticcasamuppada Sutta: This relatively short, yet profound, sutra directly translates to \"The Discourse on Dependent Origination.\" It presents the 12 links in their traditional sequence, highlighting their interconnectedness and emphasizing the potential for breaking the cycle through meditative insight. It's considered a core text for understanding this fundamental Buddhist concept.</p> </li> <li> <p>Majjhima Nikaya 38: Samyutta Nikaya Sutta: This longer sutra, also known as the \"Sutta on Mindfulness of Causation,\" offers a more elaborate exploration of the 12 links. It uses metaphors and practical instructions to guide meditators through a systematic contemplation of each link, helping them develop wisdom and detachment from the causes of suffering.</p> </li> </ol> <p>While these two sutras are prominent, you'll find references to the 12 links and related meditation practices scattered throughout various Pali Canon texts. For instance, the Visuddhimagga (\"Path of Purification\") by Buddhaghosa provides extensive commentary on the links and their role in Buddhist meditation.</p> <p>Ultimately, the choice of sutra depends on your personal preference and level of practice. The Sutta Nipata 16 offers a concise and impactful introduction, while the Majjhima Nikaya 38 provides deeper exploration and practical guidance.

kinds of sustenance (\u4e09\u8cc7\u7ce7 san-zi-liang) for our cultivation: faith (\u4fe1 xin), vows (\u9858 yuan), and practice (\u884c xing). Regardless of which one we try to develop, we must have strong resolve. Buddhism also teaches, \u201cSeek the Buddha Way and liberate all sentient beings.\u201d Here, seeking the Buddha Way is the ultimate goal of our cultivation; it requires determination to reach this goal. As for liberating all sentient beings, it is an essential part of cultivating the Bodhisattva Way. So, bodhisattva practitioners must have determination and patience to do it, even though it is not an easy task to guide sentient beings who have different dispositions and capacities. Difficulties are inevitable not only in Buddhist cultivation, but in anything we do. If we hesitate in forging ahead because we are afraid of unknown future obstacles, we will become entwined in a web of fear, indecision and timidity. Then, we will achieve nothing.</p> <p>In the Tang dynasty, there was a poet, Bai Juyi (\u767d\u5c45\u6613; 772-846), who was also an official. When Bai Juyi was the county chief of Qiantang (now Hangzhou), one day, he was passing by the Green Water Bridge at the foot of Mt. Qinwang and saw a group of people surrounding a Chan master to learn the Buddhadharma. Bai Juyi wondered, \u201cWhy are there so many people studying the Dharma in such a remote place? This Chan master must be a great cultivator!\u201d Riding his horse towards the crowd, Bai Juyi saw that the Chan master was sitting in a tree and said, \u201cVenerable Master, where you are sitting right now is a very dangerous place!\u201d</p> <p>This was Chan Master Niaoke (\u9ce5\u7aa0\u79aa\u5e2b; 741-824). Because he was living in a tree, he was known as Niaoke, literally \u201cBird Nest.\u201d Upon seeing Bai Juyi, Chan Master Niaoke immediately knew he was a self-centered and arrogant high official. So the master replied, \u201cCounty chief, it is your position that is truly dangerous!\u201d Puzzled, Bai Juyi asked, \u201cMy position is to govern this area. How could it be dangerous?\u201d The master answered, \u201cYour situation is like firewood, about to be engulfed by flames, and your clinging consciousness also never stops. When both your body and mind are unstable, how could you not see such imminent danger?\u201d Upon hearing this explanation, Bai Juyi further asked, \u201cVenerable Master, please tell me, what is the essence of the Buddhadharma?\u201d Master Niaoke replied, \u201cDo no evil. Perform all good.\u201d Since Bai Juyi was also familiar with the Dharma, he immediately said, \u201cI\u2019ve known this teaching for a long time. In fact, even a 3-year-old knows it!\u201d Knowing the county chief was looking down on this teaching, Master Niaoke retorted, \u201cA 3-year-old child may know it, but an 80-year-old man cannot follow it.\u201d Hearing this, Bai Juyi felt so ashamed and realized the Chan master had explained a very profound and insightful teaching using simple words. He told the master, \u201cI have come to some realization, and am eager to follow you to learn and practice the Dharma. I will definitely come back to you someday.\u201d Then, he left.</p> <p>Knowing Bai Juyi had deep virtuous roots, Chan Master Niaoke waited for almost a year. But, Bai Juyi never returned. So, one day, the master paid a visit to his official residence, only to find that Bai Juyi was out socializing. Master Niaoke then left him a poem, saying, \u201cBeing an official, you have written case judgments for forty years, deciding myriad rights and wrongs. While one family is well-off and thousands of others are resenting your decisions, your fame and glory of half a lifetime can lead to a hundred lifetimes of misery.\u201d Before long, Bai Juyi returned and saw the poem. It immediately struck a chord with him. For decades, he had longed to cultivate the Way; however, he had not seen through his attachment to people and the daily affairs around him, nor could he let go of worldly troubles and disputes. He was entangled in endless personal grudges. Awakened by the poem, he immediately made great vows and quit his job to follow Master Niaoke for cultivation.</p> <p>We see many people who cannot put what they know into practice because they have doubts and cannot let go of their attachments. But the moment we see reality as it is and let go of all attachments, we will be brave and decisive enough to practice what we have learned.</p> <ul> <li>Effortless Composure in the Changing World, p.294</li> </ul>","tags":["level 2","good","evil","precepts","kleshas","six paramitas"]},{"location":"shila/#other-summaries","title":"other summaries","text":"<ul> <li>there are so many teachings and versions and translations of teachings it is nice to have quick easy summaries here are some I have found</li> <li>some I paraphrased</li> <li>Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, a Japanese Soto Zen priest and teacher, said, \"Everything changes.
