Among the three, the dharmakaya (Dharma body)-the \"formless embodiment\" of Dharma (truth) - fully manifests (in terms of its qualities and functions) upon the perfect realization of the pure mind. Since every being inher- ently possesses the pure mind, everyone is endowed with the dharmakaya, whether it be manifest or not. So, the dharmakaya, like the pure mind, is formless and always present, without begin- ning nor end (unborn and undying). Further, the sambhogakaya\u2014 the bliss or reward body\u2014is the \"reward\" derived from realizing the myriad virtues and wisdom of the pure mind, and the nirmana- kaya \u2014the transformation body\u2014is an expedient means used to guide infinite sentient beings according to their infinite needs.  Unlike the dharmakaya, which is inherently complete in all beings, both the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya must be realized through diligent cultivation. Specifically, it is taught that these two bodies require three incalculable great kalpas of bodhisattva practice for them to perfectly and completely manifest. According to various sutras (e.g., The Sutra on the Jeweled Necklace of the Bodhisattva \u00ab ##I#T*\u00ab#\u00bb), the Dharma body of purity discussed here is the dharmakaya as defined above, and the Dharma body of merit pertains to the sambhogakaya.</p>"},{"location":"mind_seal/#1-the-core-of-mahayana-practice","title":"1 | The Core of Mahayana Practice","text":"<p>The Buddha said to Subhuti, \"The bodhisattvas and maha-sattvas should thus subdue their minds: All the different types of sentient beings's \u2014whether they are born from eggs, from wombs, from moisture, or by transformation;\" whether they have form or no form; whether they have thoughts or no thoughts, or have neither thought nor non-thought' - I will liberate them, by leading them to nirvana without residue!

Day by day, one season slips into the next. Day turns into night and night to day. Buildings don't suddenly grow old; rather, second by second, from the moment they're constructed, they begin to deteriorate...  Think of beings inhabiting this universe. How many people born a hundred years ago are still alive? ... We see the play of impermanence in our relationships as well. How many of our family members, friends, people in our hometown, have died? How many have moved away, disappearing from our lives forever?.. At one time we felt happy just being near a person we loved. Just to hold that person's hand made us feel wonderful. Now maybe we can't stand him, we don't want to know anything about him. Whatever comes together must fall apart, whatever once fathered must separate, what- ever was born must die.
