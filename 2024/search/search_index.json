It is considered to be one of the most important sutras in Mahayana Buddhism, and it has been studied and commented on by countless Buddhist scholars and practitioners over the centuries.</p> <p>The Diamond Sutra is divided into 32 chapters, each of which deals with a different aspect of emptiness and prajnaparamita. The sutra is a dialogue between the Buddha and his disciple Subhuti, and it explores the nature of reality, the self, and the path to enlightenment.</p> <ul> <li>Key Themes</li> </ul> <p>Emptiness: The Diamond Sutra teaches that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, meaning that they do not exist independently of other phenomena. This does not mean that phenomena do not exist at all; it simply means that they exist in a state of dependent origination.</p> <p>Prajnaparamita: Prajnaparamita is the wisdom that sees the true nature of reality, which is emptiness. It is the antidote to ignorance, which is the root cause of suffering.</p> <p>Non-attachment: The Diamond Sutra teaches that we should not be attached to anything, including our own bodies, minds, and thoughts. This is because attachment is the source of suffering.</p> <p>The Middle Way: The Diamond Sutra teaches the Middle Way, which is the path that avoids the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification. The Middle Way is the path to enlightenment.</p> <ul> <li>Conclusion</li> </ul> <p>The Diamond Sutra is a profound and complex text that has been interpreted in many different ways.

Among the three, the dharmakaya (Dharma body)-the \"formless embodiment\" of Dharma (truth) - fully manifests (in terms of its qualities and functions) upon the perfect realization of the pure mind. Since every being inher- ently possesses the pure mind, everyone is endowed with the dharmakaya, whether it be manifest or not. So, the dharmakaya, like the pure mind, is formless and always present, without begin- ning nor end (unborn and undying). Further, the sambhogakaya\u2014 the bliss or reward body\u2014is the \"reward\" derived from realizing the myriad virtues and wisdom of the pure mind, and the nirmana- kaya \u2014the transformation body\u2014is an expedient means used to guide infinite sentient beings according to their infinite needs.  Unlike the dharmakaya, which is inherently complete in all beings, both the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya must be realized through diligent cultivation. Specifically, it is taught that these two bodies require three incalculable great kalpas of bodhisattva practice for them to perfectly and completely manifest. According to various sutras (e.g., The Sutra on the Jeweled Necklace of the Bodhisattva \u00ab ##I#T*\u00ab#\u00bb), the Dharma body of purity discussed here is the dharmakaya as defined above, and the Dharma body of merit pertains to the sambhogakaya.</p>"},{"location":"mind_seal/#1-the-core-of-mahayana-practice","title":"1 | The Core of Mahayana Practice","text":"<p>The Buddha said to Subhuti, \"The bodhisattvas and maha-sattvas should thus subdue their minds: All the different types of sentient beings's \u2014whether they are born from eggs, from wombs, from moisture, or by transformation;\" whether they have form or no form; whether they have thoughts or no thoughts, or have neither thought nor non-thought' - I will liberate them, by leading them to nirvana without residue!

Why?</p> <p>All conditioned dharmas Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, Like dew or a flash of lightning; Thus we shall perceive them. With this, the Buddha concluded the sutra.

But this kind of solution does not apply to the spiri- tual path. ... Once we commit ourselves to the spiritual path, it is very painful and we are in for it. We have commit- ted ourselves to the pain of exposing ourselves, of taking off our clothes, our skin, nerves, heart, brains, until we are exposed to the universe. Nothing will be left. It will be terri- ble, excruciating, but that is the way it is.</p> <p>DESTRUCTIVE ENLIGHTENMENT ADYASHANTI</p> <p>Make no mistake about it\u2014 enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth.  It's seeing through the fa\u00e7ade of pretense. It's the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.\"</p> <p>DISAPPOINTMENT -Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche</p> <p>We must surrender our hopes and expectations, as well as our fears, and march directly into disappointment, work with disappointment, go into it and make it our way of life.... If we can open, then we suddenly begin to see that our expec- tations are irrelevant compared with the reality of the situa- tions we are facing.  This automatically brings disappointment. Disappointment is the best chariot to use on the path of the dharma. It does not confirm the existence of our ego and its dreams.</p> <p>OUR WORLD IS RELENTLESSLY IMPERMANENT - Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche</p> <p>Change is continuous. Day by day, one season slips into the next. Day turns into night and night to day. Buildings don't suddenly grow old; rather, second by second, from the moment they're constructed, they begin to deteriorate...  Think of beings inhabiting this universe. How many people born a hundred years ago are still alive? ... We see the play of impermanence in our relationships as well. How many of our family members, friends, people in our hometown, have died? How many have moved away, disappearing from our lives forever?.. At one time we felt happy just being near a person we loved. Just to hold that person's hand made us feel wonderful. Now maybe we can't stand him, we don't want to know anything about him. Whatever comes together must fall apart, whatever once fathered must separate, what- ever was born must die. Continual change, relentless change, is constant in our world.</p> <p>WHAT ARE PHENOMENA EMPTY OF?  \u2014 His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama</p> <p>When we speak of a phenomenon as being empty, we are referring to its being empty of its own inherent existence.  \u2022 Further, it is not that the object of the negation [inherent existence] formerly existed and is later eliminated, like the forest that existed yesterday and is burned by fire today, with the result that the area is now empty of the forest. Rather, this is an emptiness of an object of negation [inherent exis- tence], which from beginningless time has never been known validly to exist.</p>"},{"location":"todo/","title":"todo cli integration","text":"<ul> <li>my workflow template deployments always include todo cli</li> <li>except I use aliases so it runs from inside any folder</li> <li>tasks are rendered on mkdocs</li> <li>tasks sometimes become a project</li> </ul>","tags":["mkdocs","todo"]},{"location":"todo/#screencast","title":"screencast","text":"","tags":["mkdocs","todo"]},{"location":"todo/#layout","title":"layout","text":"<pre><code>todocli/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 done.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 report.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 todo.cfg\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 todo.sh\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 todo.txt\n&lt;projects&gt;/ template or whatever\n</code></pre>","tags":["mkdocs","todo"]},{"location":"todo/#todotxt","title":"todo.txt","text":"<pre><code>(B) migrate my previous book journals from buddhism books I studied during covid\n(B) migrate my previous book journals from the old mkdocs site\n(B) migrate my previous book journals from joplin\n(B) migrate my previous book journals from obsidian\n(B) migrate wordpress content here\n(A) w6\n(A) diamond sutra meditation checklist - chpt 8 next\n(A) heart sutra meditation checklist \n(A) glossary.md\n</code></pre>","tags":["mkdocs","todo"]},{"location":"todo/#donetxt","title":"done.txt","text":"<pre><code>x 2023-09-18 enable comments\nx 2023-09-20 w2\nx 2023-09-26 w3\nx 2023-10-03 skhandas and chachaka sutras\nx 2023-10-10 w4\nx 2023-10-17 w5\nx 2023-10-22 record meditations\nx 2023-10-22 release\n</code></pre>","tags":["mkdocs","todo"]},{"location":"todo/#alias","title":"alias","text":"","tags":["mkdocs","todo"]},{"location":"todo/#usage","title":"usage","text":"<pre><code>  Usage: todo.sh [-fhpantvV] [-d todo_config] action [task_number] [task_description]\n\n  Actions:\n    add|a \"THING I NEED TO DO +project @context\"\n    addm \"THINGS I NEED TO DO\n          MORE THINGS I NEED TO DO\"\n    addto DEST \"TEXT TO ADD\"\n    append|app ITEM# \"TEXT TO APPEND\"\n    archive\n    command [ACTIONS]\n    deduplicate\n    del|rm ITEM# [TERM]\n    depri|dp ITEM#[, ITEM#, ITEM#, ...]\n    do ITEM#[, ITEM#, ITEM#, ...]\n    help [ACTION...]\n    list|ls [TERM...]\n    listall|lsa [TERM...]\n    listaddons\n    listcon|lsc [TERM...]\n    listfile|lf [SRC [TERM...]]\n    listpri|lsp [PRIORITIES] [TERM...]\n    listproj|lsprj [TERM...]\n    move|mv ITEM# DEST [SRC]\n    prepend|prep ITEM# \"TEXT TO PREPEND\"\n    pri|p ITEM# PRIORITY\n    replace ITEM# \"UPDATED TODO\"\n    report\n    shorthelp\n\n  Actions can be added and overridden using scripts in the actions\n  directory.\n\n  See \"help\" for more details.\n</code></pre>","tags":["mkdocs","todo"]},{"location":"workflow/","title":"workflow","text":"<ul> <li>these are my notes on maintaining this site</li> <li>this site uses mkdocs + mike + commitizen</li> <li>I am using the main branch named 2024 alias latest</li> <li>or checkout other versions to update previous years</li> <li>each has their own workflow page</li> <li>deploy changes to 2024 using this script:</li> </ul> <pre><code>./push.sh\n# for manual one offs\n# ./utils/mike.sh\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>to preview changes use the local mike server</li> <li>http://localhost:8000</li> </ul> <pre><code>mike list\nmike deploy 2024 latest\n# optional add push\nmike deploy 2024 latest --push\nmike serve\n</code></pre>","tags":["workflow"]},{"location":"workflow/#adding-new-versions","title":"adding new versions","text":"<ul> <li>create a new branch <code>2025</code></li> <li><code>touch .placeholder</code></li> <li><code>mike deploy 2025 latest --push</code></li> <li><code>mike set-defaul 2025</code></li> <li>to have a file to push to the remote</li> <li>run <code>git add . &amp;&amp;
